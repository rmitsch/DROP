"Abstraction, Simplification, Approximation",SciVis,2015,Mining Graphs for Understanding Time-Varying Volumetric Data,"A notable recent trend in time-varying volumetric data analysis and visualization is to extract data relationships and represent them in a low-dimensional abstract graph view for visual understanding and making connections to the underlying data. Nevertheless, the ever-growing size and complexity of data demands novel techniques that go beyond standard brushing and linking to allow significant reduction of cognition overhead and interaction cost. In this paper, we present a mining approach that automatically extracts meaningful features from a graph-based representation for exploring time-varying volumetric data. This is achieved through the utilization of a series of graph analysis techniques including graph simplification, community detection, and visual recommendation. We investigate the most important transition relationships for time-varying data and evaluate our solution with several time-varying data sets of different sizes and characteristics. For gaining insights from the data, we show that our solution is more efficient and effective than simply asking users to extract relationships via standard interaction techniques, especially when the data set is large and the relationships are complex. We also collect expert feedback to confirm the usefulness of our approach.","time-varying visualization,visual recommendation,community detection,graph simplification",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2468031
"Abstraction, Simplification, Approximation",InfoVis,2014,NeuroLines: A Subway Map Metaphor for Visualizing Nanoscale Neuronal Connectivity,"We present NeuroLines, a novel visualization technique designed for scalable detailed analysis of neuronal connectivity at the nanoscale level. The topology of 3D brain tissue data is abstracted into a multi-scale, relative distance-preserving subway map visualization that allows domain scientists to conduct an interactive analysis of neurons and their connectivity. Nanoscale connectomics aims at reverse- engineering the wiring of the brain. Reconstructing and analyzing the detailed connectivity of neurons and neurites (axons, dendrites) will be crucial for understanding the brain and its development and diseases. However, the enormous scale and complexity of nanoscale neuronal connectivity pose big challenges to existing visualization techniques in terms of scalability. NeuroLines offers a scalable visualization framework that can interactively render thousands of neurites, and that supports the detailed analysis of neuronal structures and their connectivity. We describe and analyze the design of NeuroLines based on two real-world use-cases of our collaborators in developmental neuroscience, and investigate its scalability to large-scale neuronal connectivity data.","focus+context,neuroscience,connectomics,multi-trees,data abstraction",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346312
"Abstraction, Simplification, Approximation",InfoVis,2014,LiveGantt: Interactively Visualizing a Large Manufacturing Schedule,"In this paper, we introduce LiveGantt as a novel interactive schedule visualization tool that helps users explore highly-concurrent large schedules from various perspectives. Although a Gantt chart is the most common approach to illustrate schedules, currently available Gantt chart visualization tools suffer from limited scalability and lack of interactions. LiveGantt is built with newly designed algorithms and interactions to improve conventional charts with better scalability, explorability, and reschedulability. It employs resource reordering and task aggregation to display the schedules in a scalable way. LiveGantt provides four coordinated views and filtering techniques to help users explore and interact with the schedules in more flexible ways. In addition, LiveGantt is equipped with an efficient rescheduler to allow users to instantaneously modify their schedules based on their scheduling experience in the fields. To assess the usefulness of the application of LiveGantt, we conducted a case study on manufacturing schedule data with four industrial engineering researchers. Participants not only grasped an overview of a schedule but also explored the schedule from multiple perspectives to make enhancements.","simplification,simulation,event sequence visualization,exploratory interactions,schedule visualization",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346454
"Abstraction, Simplification, Approximation",InfoVis,2014,Stenomaps: Shorthand for shapes,"We address some of the challenges in representing spatial data with a novel form of geometric abstraction-the stenomap. The stenomap comprises a series of smoothly curving linear glyphs that each represent both the boundary and the area of a polygon. We present an efficient algorithm to automatically generate these open, C1-continuous splines from a set of input polygons. Feature points of the input polygons are detected using the medial axis to maintain important shape properties. We use dynamic programming to compute a planar non- intersecting spline representing each polygon's base shape. The results are stylised glyphs whose appearance may be parameterised and that offer new possibilities in the 'cartographic design space'. We compare our glyphs with existing forms of geometric schematisation and discuss their relative merits and shortcomings. We describe several use cases including the depiction of uncertain model data in the form of hurricane track forecasting; minimal ink thematic mapping; and the depiction of continuous statistical data.","design,algorithm,maps,schematisation",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346274
"Abstraction, Simplification, Approximation",InfoVis,2014,Origin-Destination Flow Data Smoothing and Mapping,"This paper presents a new approach to flow mapping that extracts inherent patterns from massive geographic mobility data and constructs effective visual representations of the data for the understanding of complex flow trends. This approach involves a new method for origin-destination flow density estimation and a new method for flow map generalization, which together can remove spurious data variance, normalize flows with control population, and detect high-level patterns that are not discernable with existing approaches. The approach achieves three main objectives in addressing the challenges for analyzing and mapping massive flow data. First, it removes the effect of size differences among spatial units via kernel-based density estimation, which produces a measurement of flow volume between each pair of origin and destination. Second, it extracts major flow patterns in massive flow data through a new flow sampling method, which filters out duplicate information in the smoothed flows. Third, it enables effective flow mapping and allows intuitive perception of flow patterns among origins and destinations without bundling or altering flow paths. The approach can work with both point-based flow data (such as taxi trips with GPS locations) and area-based flow data (such as county-to-county migration). Moreover, the approach can be used to detect and compare flow patterns at different scales or in relatively sparse flow datasets, such as migration for each age group. We evaluate and demonstrate the new approach with case studies of U.S. migration data and experiments with synthetic data.","graph drawing,flow mapping,kernel smoothing,multi-resolution mapping,generalization,spatial data mining",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346271
"Abstraction, Simplification, Approximation",SciVis,2014,Decomposition and Simplification of Multivariate Data using Pareto Sets,"Topological and structural analysis of multivariate data is aimed at improving the understanding and usage of such data through identification of intrinsic features and structural relationships among multiple variables. We present two novel methods for simplifying so-called Pareto sets that describe such structural relationships. Such simplification is a precondition for meaningful visualization of structurally rich or noisy data. As a framework for simplification operations, we introduce a decomposition of the data domain into regions of equivalent structural behavior and the reachability graph that describes global connectivity of Pareto extrema. Simplification is then performed as a sequence of edge collapses in this graph; to determine a suitable sequence of such operations, we describe and utilize a comparison measure that reflects the changes to the data that each operation represents. We demonstrate and evaluate our methods on synthetic and real-world examples.","simplification,decomposition,multivariate topology,pareto set",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346447
"Abstraction, Simplification, Approximation",SciVis,2014,Sparse PDF Volumes for Consistent Multi-Resolution Volume Rendering,"This paper presents a new multi-resolution volume representation called sparse pdf volumes, which enables consistent multi-resolution volume rendering based on probability density functions (pdfs) of voxel neighborhoods. These pdfs are defined in the 4D domain jointly comprising the 3D volume and its 1D intensity range. Crucially, the computation of sparse pdf volumes exploits data coherence in 4D, resulting in a sparse representation with surprisingly low storage requirements. At run time, we dynamically apply transfer functions to the pdfs using simple and fast convolutions. Whereas standard low-pass filtering and down-sampling incur visible differences between resolution levels, the use of pdfs facilitates consistent results independent of the resolution level used. We describe the efficient out-of-core computation of large-scale sparse pdf volumes, using a novel iterative simplification procedure of a mixture of 4D Gaussians. Finally, our data structure is optimized to facilitate interactive multi-resolution volume rendering on GPUs.","multi-resolution representation,sparse approximation,large-scale volume rendering,pursuit algorithms",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346324
"Abstraction, Simplification, Approximation",VAST,2014,Visual Abstraction and Exploration of Multi-class Scatterplots,"Scatterplots are widely used to visualize scatter dataset for exploring outliers, clusters, local trends, and correlations. Depicting multi-class scattered points within a single scatterplot view, however, may suffer from heavy overdraw, making it inefficient for data analysis. This paper presents a new visual abstraction scheme that employs a hierarchical multi-class sampling technique to show a feature-preserving simplification. To enhance the density contrast, the colors of multiple classes are optimized by taking the multi-class point distributions into account. We design a visual exploration system that supports visual inspection and quantitative analysis from different perspectives. We have applied our system to several challenging datasets, and the results demonstrate the efficiency of our approach.","scatterplot,sampling,visual abstraction,overdraw reduction",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346594
"Abstraction, Simplification, Approximation",VAST,2013,Temporal Event Sequence Simplification,"Electronic Health Records (EHRs) have emerged as a cost-effective data source for conducting medical research. The difficulty in using EHRs for research purposes, however, is that both patient selection and record analysis must be conducted across very large, and typically very noisy datasets. Our previous work introduced EventFlow, a visualization tool that transforms an entire dataset of temporal event records into an aggregated display, allowing researchers to analyze population-level patterns and trends. As datasets become larger and more varied, however, it becomes increasingly difficult to provide a succinct, summarizing display. This paper presents a series of user-driven data simplifications that allow researchers to pare event records down to their core elements. Furthermore, we present a novel metric for measuring visual complexity, and a language for codifying disjoint strategies into an overarching simplification framework. These simplifications were used by real-world researchers to gain new and valuable insights from initially overwhelming datasets.","simplification,electronic health records,temporal query,event sequences",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2013.200
"Abstraction, Simplification, Approximation",InfoVis,2012,Organizing Search Results with a Reference Map,"We propose a method to highlight query hits in hierarchically clustered collections of interrelated items such as digital libraries or knowledge bases. The method is based on the idea that organizing search results similarly to their arrangement on a fixed reference map facilitates orientation and assessment by preserving a user's mental map. Here, the reference map is built from an MDS layout of the items in a Voronoi treemap representing their hierarchical clustering, and we use techniques from dynamic graph layout to align query results with the map. The approach is illustrated on an archive of newspaper articles.","multi-dimensional scaling,edge bundling,mental map,voronoi treemaps,dynamic graph layout,search results",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2012.250
"Abstraction, Simplification, Approximation",InfoVis,2011,Skeleton-Based Edge Bundling for Graph Visualization,"In this paper, we present a novel approach for constructing bundled layouts of general graphs. As layout cues for bundles, we use medial axes, or skeletons, of edges which are similar in terms of position information. We combine edge clustering, distance fields, and 2D skeletonization to construct progressively bundled layouts for general graphs by iteratively attracting edges towards the centerlines of level sets of their distance fields. Apart from clustering, our entire pipeline is image-based with an efficient implementation in graphics hardware. Besides speed and implementation simplicity, our method allows explicit control of the emphasis on structure of the bundled layout, i.e. the creation of strongly branching (organic-like) or smooth bundles. We demonstrate our method on several large real-world graphs.","graphlayout,edge bundling,image-based information visualization",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2011.233
"Abstraction, Simplification, Approximation",InfoVis,2011,Divided Edge Bundling for Directional Network Data,"The node-link diagram is an intuitive and venerable way to depict a graph. To reduce clutter and improve the readability of node-link views, Holten & van Wijk's force-directed edge bundling employs a physical simulation to spatially group graph edges. While both useful and aesthetic, this technique has shortcomings: it bundles spatially proximal edges regardless of direction, weight, or graph connectivity. As a result, high-level directional edge patterns are obscured. We present divided edge bundling to tackle these shortcomings. By modifying the forces in the physical simulation, directional lanes appear as an emergent property of edge direction. By considering graph topology, we only bundle edges related by graph structure. Finally, we aggregate edge weights in bundles to enable more accurate visualization of total bundle weights. We compare visualizations created using our technique to standard force-directed edge bundling, matrix diagrams, and clustered graphs; we find that divided edge bundling leads to visualizations that are easier to interpret and reveal both familiar and previously obscured patterns.","graphvisualization,node-link diagrams,aggregation,edge bundling,physical simulation",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2011.190
"Abstraction, Simplification, Approximation",InfoVis,2009,Conjunctive Visual Forms,"Visual exploration of multidimensional data is a process of isolating and extracting relationships within and between dimensions. Coordinated multiple view approaches are particularly effective for visual exploration because they support precise expression of heterogeneous multidimensional queries using simple interactions. Recent visual analytics research has made significant progress in identifying and understanding patterns of composed views and coordinations that support fast, flexible, and open-ended data exploration. What is missing is formalization of the space of expressible queries in terms of visual representation and interaction. This paper introduces the conjunctive visual form model in which visual exploration consists of interactively-driven sequences of transitions between visual states that correspond to conjunctive normal forms in boolean logic. The model predicts several new and useful ways to extend the space of rapidly expressible queries through addition of simple interactive capabilities to existing compositional patterns. Two recent related visual tools offer a subset of these capabilities, providing a basis for conjecturing about such extensions.","multipleviews,brushing,exploratory visualization,visual abstraction,boolean query,conjunctive normal form",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2009.129
