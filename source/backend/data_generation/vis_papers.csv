"Abstraction, Simplification, Approximation",VAST,2015,Interactive Visual Profiling of Musicians,"Determining similar objects based upon the features of an object of interest is a common task for visual analytics systems. This process is called profiling, if the object of interest is a person with individual attributes. The profiling of musicians similar to a musician of interest with the aid of visual means became an interesting research question for musicologists working with the Bavarian Musicians Encyclopedia Online. This paper illustrates the development of a visual analytics profiling system that is used to address such research questions. Taking musicological knowledge into account, we outline various steps of our collaborative digital humanities project, priority (1) the definition of various measures to determine the similarity of musicians' attributes, and (2) the design of an interactive profiling system that supports musicologists in iteratively determining similar musicians. The utility of the profiling system is emphasized by various usage scenarios illustrating current research questions in musicology.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467620
"Abstraction, Simplification, Approximation",Vis,2008,AD-Frustum: Adaptive Frustum Tracing for Interactive Sound Propagation,"We present an interactive algorithm to compute sound propagation paths for transmission, specular reflection and edge diffraction in complex scenes. Our formulation uses an adaptive frustum representation that is automatically sub-divided to accurately compute intersections with the scene primitives. We describe a simple and fast algorithm to approximate the visible surface for each frustum and generate new frusta based on specular reflection and edge diffraction. Our approach is applicable to all triangulated models and we demonstrate its performance on architectural and outdoor models with tens or hundreds of thousands of triangles and moving objects. In practice, our algorithm can perform geometric sound propagation in complex scenes at 4-20 frames per second on a multi-core PC.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2008.111
"Abstraction, Simplification, Approximation",Vis,2007,Listener-based Analysis of Surface Importance for Acoustic Metrics,"Acoustic quality in room acoustics is measured by well defined quantities, like definition, which can be derived from simulated impulse response filters or measured values. These take into account the intensity and phase shift of multiple reflections due to a wave front emanating from a sound source. Definition (D50) and clarity (C50) for example correspond to the fraction of the energy received in total to the energy received in the first 50 ms at a certain listener position. Unfortunately, the impulse response measured at a single point does not provide any information about the direction of reflections, and about the reflection surfaces which contribute to this measure. For the visualization of room acoustics, however, this information is very useful since it allows to discover regions with high contribution and provides insight into the influence of all reflecting surfaces to the quality measure. We use the phonon tracing method to calculate the contribution of the reflection surfaces to the impulse response for different listener positions. This data is used to compute importance values for the geometry taking a certain acoustic metric into account. To get a visual insight into the directional aspect, we map the importance to the reflecting surfaces of the geometry. This visualization indicates which parts of the surfaces need to be changed to enhance the chosen acoustic quality measure. We apply our method to the acoustic improvement of a lecture hall by means of enhancing the overall speech comprehensibility (clarity) and evaluate the results using glyphs to visualize the clarity (C50) values at listener positions throughout the room.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2007.70575
"Abstraction, Simplification, Approximation",Vis,2007,Interactive sound rendering in complex and dynamic scenes using frustum tracing,"We present a new approach for real-time sound rendering in complex, virtual scenes with dynamic sources and objects. Our approach combines the efficiency of interactive ray tracing with the accuracy of tracing a volumetric representation. We use a four-sided convex frustum and perform clipping and intersection tests using ray packet tracing. A simple and efficient formulation is used to compute secondary frusta and perform hierarchical traversal. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm in an interactive system for complex environments and architectural models with tens or hundreds of thousands of triangles. Our algorithm can perform real-time simulation and rendering on a high-end PC.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2007.70567
"Abstraction, Simplification, Approximation",Vis,2006,Comparative Visualization for Wave-based and Geometric Acoustics,"We present a comparative visualization of the acoustic simulation results obtained by two different approaches that were combined into a single simulation algorithm. The first method solves the wave equation on a volume grid based on finite elements. The second method, phonon tracing, is a geometric approach that we have previously developed for interactive simulation, visualization and modeling of room acoustics. Geometric approaches of this kind are more efficient than FEM in the high and medium frequency range. For low frequencies they fail to represent diffraction, which on the other hand can be simulated properly by means of FEM. When combining both methods we need to calibrate them properly and estimate in which frequency range they provide comparable results. For this purpose we use an acoustic metric called gain and display the resulting error. Furthermore we visualize interference patterns, since these depend not only on diffraction, but also exhibit phase-dependent amplification and neutralization effects",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2006.125
"Abstraction, Simplification, Approximation",Vis,2005,Phonon tracing for auralization and visualization of sound - IEEE Conference Publication,"We present a new particle tracing approach for the simulation of mid- and high-frequency sound. Inspired by the photorealism obtained by methods like photon mapping, we develop a similar method for the physical simulation of sound within rooms. For given source and listener positions, our method computes a finite-response filter accounting for the different reflections at various surfaces with frequency-dependent absorption coefficients. Convoluting this filter with an anechoic input signal reproduces a realistic aural impression of the simulated room. We do not consider diffraction effects due to low frequencies, since these can be better computed by finite elements. Our method allows the visualization of a wave front propagation using color-coded blobs traversing the paths of individual phonons.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2005.1532790

The Whole Field Modelling System has provided an extremely accurate real-time visualization of a large number of varying parameters such as remotely operated vehicles, cranes, barges, grabs, magnets, and detailed seabed topography. The system has improved the field staffs' spatial and temporal awareness of the underwater environment and facilitated decision-making within the complex offshore working environment.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2000.885743
"Abstraction, Simplification, Approximation",Vis,2000,Case study: a methodology for plume visualization with application to real- time acquisition and navigation - IEEE Conference Publication,"Applications of visualization techniques that facilitate comparison of simulation and field datasets of seafloor hydrothermal plumes are demonstrated in order to explore and confirm theories of plume behavior. In comparing these datasets, there is no one-to-one correspondence. We show the comparison by performing quantitative capturing of large scale observable features. The comparisons are needed not only to improve the relevance of the simulations to the field observations, but also to enable real time adjustment of shipboard data collection systems. Our approach for comparing simulation and field datasets is to use skeletonization and centerline representation. Features representing plumes are skeletonized. Skeleton points are used to construct a centerline and to quantify plume properties on planes normal to the centerline. These skeleton points are further used to construct an idealized cone representing a plume isosurface. The difference between the plume feature and the cone is identified as protrusions of turbulent eddies. Comparison of the simulation and field data sets through these abstractions illustrates how these abstractions characterize a plume.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2000.885737
"Abstraction, Simplification, Approximation",Vis,1996,LISTEN: sounding uncertainty visualization - IEEE Conference Publication,"Integrated presentation of data with uncertainty is a worthy goal in scientific visualization. It allows researchers to make informed decisions based on imperfect data. It also allows users to visually compare and contrast different algorithms for performing the same task or different models for representing the same physical phenomenon. We present LISTEN-a data sonification system that has been incorporated into two visualization systems: a system for visualizing geometric uncertainty of surface interpolants; and a system for visualizing uncertainty in fluid flow. LISTEN is written in C++ for the SGI platform. It works with the SGI internal audio chip or a MIDI device or both. LISTEN is an object-oriented system that is modular, flexible, adaptable, portable, interactive and extensible. We demonstrate that sonification is very effective as an additional tool in visualizing geometric and fluid flow uncertainty.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1996.568105
"Acoustics, Sound, Sonification",SciVis,2015,Adaptive Multilinear Tensor Product Wavelets,"Many foundational visualization techniques including isosurfacing, direct volume rendering and texture mapping rely on piecewise multilinear interpolation over the cells of a mesh. However, there has not been much focus within the visualization community on techniques that efficiently generate and encode globally continuous functions defined by the union of multilinear cells. Wavelets provide a rich context for analyzing and processing complicated datasets. In this paper, we exploit adaptive regular refinement as a means of representing and evaluating functions described by a subset of their nonzero wavelet coefficients. We analyze the dependencies involved in the wavelet transform and describe how to generate and represent the coarsest adaptive mesh with nodal function values such that the inverse wavelet transform is exactly reproduced via simple interpolation (subdivision) over the mesh elements. This allows for an adaptive, sparse representation of the function with on-demand evaluation at any point in the domain. We focus on the popular wavelets formed by tensor products of linear B-splines, resulting in an adaptive, nonconforming but crack-free quadtree (2D) or octree (3D) mesh that allows reproducing globally continuous functions via multilinear interpolation over its cells.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467412
"Acoustics, Sound, Sonification",Vis,2013,Adaptive Refinement of the Flow Map Using Sparse Samples,"We present a new efficient and scalable method for the high quality reconstruction of the flow map from sparse samples. The flow map describes the transport of massless particles along the flow. As such, it is a fundamental concept in the analysis of transient flow phenomena and all so-called Lagrangian flow visualization techniques require its approximation. The flow map is generally obtained by integrating a dense 1D, 2D, or 3D set of particles across the domain of definition of the flow. Despite its embarrassingly parallel nature, this computation creates a performance bottleneck in the analysis of large-scale datasets that existing adaptive techniques alleviate only partially. Our iterative approximation method significantly improves upon the state of the art by precisely modeling the flow behavior around automatically detected geometric structures embedded in the flow, thus effectively restricting the sampling effort to interesting regions. Our data reconstruction is based on a modified version of Sibson's scattered data interpolation and allows us at each step to offer an intermediate dense approximation of the flow map and to seamlessly integrate regions that will be further refined in subsequent steps. We present a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of our method on different types of flow datasets and offer a detailed comparison with existing techniques.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2013.128
"Acoustics, Sound, Sonification",Vis,2011,Visualization of AMR Data With Multi-Level Dual-Mesh Interpolation,"We present a new technique for providing interpolation within cell-centered Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) data that achieves C0 continuity throughout the 3D domain. Our technique improves on earlier work in that it does not require that adjacent patches differ by at most one refinement level. Our approach takes the dual of each mesh patch and generates \""stitching cells\"" on the fly to fill the gaps between dual meshes. We demonstrate applications of our technique with data from Enzo, an AMR cosmological structure formation simulation code. We show ray-cast visualizations that include contributions from particle data (dark matter and stars, also output by Enzo) and gridded hydrodynamic data. We also show results from isosurface studies, including surfaces in regions where adjacent patches differ by more than one refinement level.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2011.252
"Acoustics, Sound, Sonification",Vis,2010,Gradient Estimation Revitalized,"We investigate the use of a Fourier-domain derivative error kernel to quantify the error incurred while estimating the gradient of a function from scalar point samples on a regular lattice. We use the error kernel to show that gradient reconstruction quality is significantly enhanced merely by shifting the reconstruction kernel to the centers of the principal lattice directions. Additionally, we exploit the algebraic similarities between the scalar and derivative error kernels to design asymptotically optimal gradient estimation filters that can be factored into an infinite impulse response interpolation prefilter and a finite impulse response directional derivative filter. This leads to a significant performance gain both in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. The interpolation prefilter provides an accurate scalar approximation and can be re-used to cheaply compute directional derivatives on-the-fly without the need to store gradients. We demonstrate the impact of our filters in the context of volume rendering of scalar data sampled on the Cartesian and Body-Centered Cubic lattices. Our results rival those obtained from other competitive gradient estimation methods while incurring no additional computational or storage overhead.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2010.160
"Acoustics, Sound, Sonification",Vis,2010,Computing Robustness and Persistence for Images,"We are interested in 3-dimensional images given as arrays of voxels with intensity values. Extending these values to a continuous function, we study the robustness of homology classes in its level and interlevel sets, that is, the amount of perturbation needed to destroy these classes. The structure of the homology classes and their robustness, over all level and interlevel sets, can be visualized by a triangular diagram of dots obtained by computing the extended persistence of the function. We give a fast hierarchical algorithm using the dual complexes of oct-tree approximations of the function. In addition, we show that for balanced oct- trees, the dual complexes are geometrically realized in R3 and can thus be used to construct level and interlevel sets. We apply these tools to study 3-dimensional images of plant root systems.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2010.139
"Acoustics, Sound, Sonification",Vis,2009,Supercubes: A High-Level Primitive for Diamond Hierarchies,"Volumetric datasets are often modeled using a multiresolution approach based on a nested decomposition of the domain into a polyhedral mesh. Nested tetrahedral meshes generated through the longest edge bisection rule are commonly used to decompose regular volumetric datasets since they produce highly adaptive crack-free representations. Efficient representations for such models have been achieved by clustering the set of tetrahedra sharing a common longest edge into a structure called a diamond. The alignment and orientation of the longest edge can be used to implicitly determine the geometry of a diamond and its relations to the other diamonds within the hierarchy. We introduce the supercube as a high-level primitive within such meshes that encompasses all unique types of diamonds. A supercube is a coherent set of edges corresponding to three consecutive levels of subdivision. Diamonds are uniquely characterized by the longest edge of the tetrahedra forming them and are clustered in supercubes through the association of the longest edge of a diamond with a unique edge in a supercube. Supercubes are thus a compact and highly efficient means of associating information with a subset of the vertices, edges and tetrahedra of the meshes generated through longest edge bisection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the supercube representation when encoding multiresolution diamond hierarchies built on a subset of the points of a regular grid. We also show how supercubes can be used to efficiently extract meshes from diamond hierarchies and to reduce the storage requirements of such variable-resolution meshes.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2009.186
"Acoustics, Sound, Sonification",Vis,2008,Query-Driven Visualization of Time-Varying Adaptive Mesh Refinement Data,"The visualization and analysis of AMR-based simulations is integral to the process of obtaining new insight in scientific research. We present a new method for performing query-driven visualization and analysis on AMR data, with specific emphasis on time-varying AMR data. Our work introduces a new method that directly addresses the dynamic spatial and temporal properties of AMR grids that challenge many existing visualization techniques. Further, we present the first implementation of query-driven visualization on the GPU that uses a GPU-based indexing structure to both answer queries and efficiently utilize GPU memory. We apply our method to two different science domains to demonstrate its broad applicability.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2008.157
"Acoustics, Sound, Sonification",Vis,2004,Volume refinement fairing isosurfaces - IEEE Conference Publication,We propose an interpolating refinement method for two- and three-dimensional scalar fields defined on hexahedral grids. Iterative fairing of the underlying contours (isosurfaces) provides the function values of new grid points. Our method can be considered as a nonlinear variational subdivision scheme for volumes. It can be applied locally for adaptive mesh refinement in regions of high geometric complexity. We use our scheme to increase the quality of low-resolution data sets and to reduce interpolation artifacts in texture-based volume rendering.,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2004.127
"Acoustics, Sound, Sonification",Vis,2003,Monte Carlo volume rendering - IEEE Conference Publication,"In this paper a novel volume-rendering technique based on Monte Carlo integration is presented. As a result of a preprocessing, a point cloud of random samples is generated using a normalized continuous reconstruction of the volume as a probability density function. This point cloud is projected onto the image plane, and to each pixel an intensity value is assigned which is proportional to the number of samples projected onto the corresponding pixel area. In such a way a simulated X-ray image of the volume can be obtained. Theoretically, for a fixed image resolution, there exists an M number of samples such that the average standard deviation of the estimated pixel intensities us under the level of quantization error regardless of the number of voxels. Therefore Monte Carlo Volume Rendering (MCVR) is mainly proposed to efficiently visualize large volume data sets. Furthermore, network applications are also supported, since the trade-off between image quality and interactivity can be adapted to the bandwidth of the client/server connection by using progressive refinement.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2003.1250406
"Acoustics, Sound, Sonification",Vis,2003,Quasi-static approach approximation for 6 degrees-of-freedom haptic rendering - IEEE Conference Publication,"In this paper, we propose a quasi-static approximation (QSA) approach to simulate the movement of the movable object in 6-degrees-of-freedom (DOF) haptic rendering. In our QSA approach, we solve for static equilibrium during each haptic time step, ignoring any dynamical properties such as inertia. The major contribution of this approach is to overcome the computational instability problem in overly stiff systems arising from numerical integration of second- order differential equations in previous dynamic models. Our primary experimental results on both simulated aircraft geometry and a large-scale real-world aircraft engine showed that our QSA approach was capable of maintaining the 1000Hz haptic refresh rate with more robust collision avoidance and more reliable force and torque feedback.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2003.1250380
"Acoustics, Sound, Sonification",Vis,2003,Real-time refinement and simplification of adaptive triangular meshes - IEEE Conference Publication,"In this paper we present a generic method for incremental mesh adaptation based on hierarchy of semi-regular meshes. Our method supports any refinement rule mapping vertices onto vertices such as 1-to-4 split or /spl radic/3-subdivision. Resulting adaptive mesh has subdivision connectivity and hence good aspect ratio of triangles. Hierarchic representation of the mesh allows incremental local refinement and simplification operations exploiting frame-to-frame coherence. We also present an out-of-core storage layout scheme designed for semi-regular meshes of arbitrary subdivision connectivity. It provides high cache coherency in the data retrieval and relies on the interleaved storage of resolution levels and maintaining good geometrical proximity within each level. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated with applications in physically-based cloth simulation, real-time terrain visualization and procedural modeling.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2003.1250367
"Acoustics, Sound, Sonification",Vis,2002,Approximating normals for marching cubes applied to locally supported isosurfaces - IEEE Conference Publication,"We present some new methods for computing estimates of normal vectors at the vertices of a triangular mesh surface approximation to an isosurface which has been computed by the marching cube algorithm. These estimates are required for the smooth rendering of triangular mesh surfaces. The conventional method of computing estimates based upon divided difference approximations of the gradient can lead to poor estimates in some applications. This is particularly true for isosurfaces obtained from a field function, which is defined only for values near to the isosurface. We describe some efficient methods for computing the topology of the triangular mesh surface, which is used for obtaining local estimates of the normals. In addition, a new, one pass, approach for these types of applications is described and compared to existing methods.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2002.1183808
"Acoustics, Sound, Sonification",Vis,2002,Case study: Interactive rendering of adaptive mesh refinement data - IEEE Conference Publication,"Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) is a popular computational simulation technique used in various scientific and engineering fields. Although AMR data is organized in a hierarchical multi-resolution data structure, the traditional volume visualization algorithms such as ray-casting and splatting cannot handle the form without converting it to a sophisticated data structure. In this paper, we present a hierarchical multi-resolution splatting technique using k-d trees and octrees for AMR data that is suitable for implementation on the latest consumer PC graphics hardware. We describe a graphical user interface to set transfer function and viewing/rendering parameters interactively. Experimental results obtained on a general purpose PC equipped with NVIDIA GeForce card are presented to demonstrate that the technique can interactively render AMR data (over 20 frames per second). Our scheme can easily be applied to parallel rendering of time-varying AMR data.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2002.1183820
"Acoustics, Sound, Sonification",Vis,2002,Volume warping for adaptive isosurface extraction - IEEE Conference Publication,"Polygonal approximations of isosurfaces extracted from uniformly sampled volumes are increasing in size due to the availability of higher resolution imaging techniques. The large number of I primitives represented hinders the interactive exploration of the dataset. Though many solutions have been proposed to this problem, many require the creation of isosurfaces at multiple resolutions or the use of additional data structures, often hierarchical, to represent the volume. We propose a technique for adaptive isosurface extraction that is easy to implement and allows the user to decide the degree of adaptivity as well as the choice of isosurface extraction algorithm. Our method optimizes the extraction of the isosurface by warping the volume. In a warped volume, areas of importance (e.g. containing significant details) are inflated while unimportant ones are contracted. Once the volume is warped, any extraction algorithm can be applied. The extracted mesh is subsequently unwarped such that the warped areas are rescaled to their initial proportions. The resulting isosurface is represented by a mesh that is more densely sampled in regions decided as important.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2002.1183809
"Acoustics, Sound, Sonification",Vis,2001,Smooth approximation and rendering of large scattered data sets - IEEE Conference Publication,"Presents an efficient method to automatically compute a smooth approximation of large functional scattered data sets given over arbitrarily shaped planar domains. Our approach is based on the construction of a C/sup 1/-continuous bivariate cubic spline and our method offers optimal approximation order. Both local variation and nonuniform distribution of the data are taken into account by using local polynomial least squares approximations of varying degree. Since we only need to solve small linear systems and no triangulation of the scattered data points is required, the overall complexity of the algorithm is linear in the total number of points. Numerical examples dealing with several real-world scattered data sets with up to millions of points demonstrate the efficiency of our method. The resulting spline surface is of high visual quality and can be efficiently evaluated for rendering and modeling. In our implementation we achieve real-time frame rates for typical fly-through sequences and interactive frame rates for recomputing and rendering a locally modified spline surface.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2001.964530
"Acoustics, Sound, Sonification",Vis,1999,Implant sprays: compression of progressive tetrahedral mesh connectivity - IEEE Conference Publication,"Irregular tetrahedral meshes, which are popular in many engineering and scientific applications, often contain a large number of vertices. A mesh of V vertices and T tetrahedra requires 48 V bits or less to store the vertex coordinates, 4/spl middot/T/spl middot/log/sub 2/(V) bits to store the tetrahedra-vertex incidence relations, also called connectivity information, and kV bits to store the k-bit value samples associated with the vertices. Given that T is 5 to 7 times larger than V and that V often exceeds 32/sup 3/, the storage space required for the connectivity is larger than 300 V bits and thus dominates the overall storage cost. Our \""implants spray\"" compression approach introduced in the paper reduces this cost to about 30 V bits or less-a 10:1 compression ratio. Furthermore, implant spray supports the progressive refinement of a crude model through a series of vertex-splits operations.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1999.809901
"Acoustics, Sound, Sonification",Vis,1998,Simplification of tetrahedral meshes - IEEE Conference Publication,"We present a method for the construction of multiple levels of tetrahedral meshes approximating a trivariate function at different levels of detail. Starting with an initial, high-resolution triangulation of a three-dimensional region, we construct coarser representation levels by collapsing tetrahedra. Each triangulation defines a linear spline function, where the function values associated with the vertices are the spline coefficients. Based on predicted errors, we collapse tetrahedron in the grid that do not cause the maximum error to exceed a use-specified threshold. Bounds are stored for individual tetrahedra and are updated as the mesh is simplified. We continue the simplification process until a certain error is reached. The result is a hierarchical data description suited for the efficient visualization of large data sets at varying levels of detail.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1998.745315
"Acoustics, Sound, Sonification",Vis,1998,Interpolation of triangle hierarchies - IEEE Conference Publication,"We consider interpolation between keyframe hierarchies. We impose a set of weak constraints that allows smooth interpolation between two keyframe hierarchies in an animation or, more generally, allows the interpolation in an n-parameter family of hierarchies. We use hierarchical triangulations obtained by the Rivara element bisection algorithm (M. Rivara, 1984) and impose a weak compatibility constraint on the set of root elements of all keyframe hierarchies. We show that the introduced constraints are rather weak. The strength of our approach is that the interpolation works in the class of conforming triangulations and simplifies the task of finding the intermediate hierarchy, which is the union of the two (or more) keyframe hierarchies involved in the interpolation process. This allows for an efficient generation of the intermediate connectivity and additionally ensures that the intermediate hierarchy is again a conforming hierarchy satisfying the same constraints.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1998.745328
Adaptive Processing and Refinement,SciVis,2015,Mining Graphs for Understanding Time-Varying Volumetric Data,"A notable recent trend in time-varying volumetric data analysis and visualization is to extract data relationships and represent them in a low-dimensional abstract graph view for visual understanding and making connections to the underlying data. Nevertheless, the ever-growing size and complexity of data demands novel techniques that go beyond standard brushing and linking to allow significant reduction of cognition overhead and interaction cost. In this paper, we present a mining approach that automatically extracts meaningful features from a graph-based representation for exploring time-varying volumetric data. This is achieved through the utilization of a series of graph analysis techniques including graph simplification, community detection, and visual recommendation. We investigate the most important transition relationships for time-varying data and evaluate our solution with several time-varying data sets of different sizes and characteristics. For gaining insights from the data, we show that our solution is more efficient and effective than simply asking users to extract relationships via standard interaction techniques, especially when the data set is large and the relationships are complex. We also collect expert feedback to confirm the usefulness of our approach.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2468031
Adaptive Processing and Refinement,SciVis,2015,In Situ Eddy Analysis in a High-Resolution Ocean Climate Model,"An eddy is a feature associated with a rotating body of fluid, surrounded by a ring of shearing fluid. In the ocean, eddies are 10 to 150 km in diameter, are spawned by boundary currents and baroclinic instabilities, may live for hundreds of days, and travel for hundreds of kilometers. Eddies are important in climate studies because they transport heat, salt, and nutrients through the world's oceans and are vessels of biological productivity. The study of eddies in global ocean-climate models requires large-scale, high-resolution simulations. This poses a problem for feasible (timely) eddy analysis, as ocean simulations generate massive amounts of data, causing a bottleneck for traditional analysis workflows. To enable eddy studies, we have developed an in situ workflow for the quantitative and qualitative analysis of MPAS-Ocean, a high- resolution ocean climate model, in collaboration with the ocean model research and development process. Planned eddy analysis at high spatial and temporal resolutions will not be possible with a postprocessing workflow due to various constraints, such as storage size and I/O time, but the in situ workflow enables it and scales well to ten-thousand processing elements.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467411
Adaptive Processing and Refinement,SciVis,2015,Distribution Driven Extraction and Tracking of Features for Time-varying Data Analysis,"Effective analysis of features in time-varying data is essential in numerous scientific applications. Feature extraction and tracking are two important tasks scientists rely upon to get insights about the dynamic nature of the large scale time-varying data. However, often the complexity of the scientific phenomena only allows scientists to vaguely define their feature of interest. Furthermore, such features can have varying motion patterns and dynamic evolution over time. As a result, automatic extraction and tracking of features becomes a non-trivial task. In this work, we investigate these issues and propose a distribution driven approach which allows us to construct novel algorithms for reliable feature extraction and tracking with high confidence in the absence of accurate feature definition. We exploit two key properties of an object, motion and similarity to the target feature, and fuse the information gained from them to generate a robust feature-aware classification field at every time step. Tracking of features is done using such classified fields which enhances the accuracy and robustness of the proposed algorithm. The efficacy of our method is demonstrated by successfully applying it on several scientific data sets containing a wide range of dynamic time-varying features.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467436
Adaptive Processing and Refinement,SciVis,2015,"Extracting, Tracking, and Visualizing Magnetic Flux Vortices in 3D Complex- Valued Superconductor Simulation Data","We propose a method for the vortex extraction and tracking of superconducting magnetic flux vortices for both structured and unstructured mesh data. In the Ginzburg-Landau theory, magnetic flux vortices are well- defined features in a complex-valued order parameter field, and their dynamics determine electromagnetic properties in type-II superconductors. Our method represents each vortex line (a 1D curve embedded in 3D space) as a connected graph extracted from the discretized field in both space and time. For a time- varying discrete dataset, our vortex extraction and tracking method is as accurate as the data discretization. We then apply 3D visualization and 2D event diagrams to the extraction and tracking results to help scientists understand vortex dynamics and macroscale superconductor behavior in greater detail than previously possible.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2466838
Adaptive Processing and Refinement,SciVis,2014,Trajectory-Based Flow Feature Tracking in Joint Particle/Volume Datasets,"Studying the dynamic evolution of time- varying volumetric data is essential in countless scientific endeavors. The ability to isolate and track features of interest allows domain scientists to better manage large complex datasets both in terms of visual understanding and computational efficiency. This work presents a new trajectory-based feature tracking technique for use in joint particle/volume datasets. While traditional feature tracking approaches generally require a high temporal resolution, this method utilizes the indexed trajectories of corresponding Lagrangian particle data to efficiently track features over large jumps in time. Such a technique is especially useful for situations where the volume dataset is either temporally sparse or too large to efficiently track a feature through all intermediate timesteps. In addition, this paper presents a few other applications of this approach, such as the ability to efficiently track the internal properties of volumetric features using variables from the particle data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique using real world combustion and atmospheric datasets and compare it to existing tracking methods to justify its advantages and accuracy.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346423
Adaptive Processing and Refinement,VAST,2014,Visual Methods for Analyzing Probabilistic Classification Data,"Multi- class classifiers often compute scores for the classification samples describing probabilities to belong to different classes. In order to improve the performance of such classifiers, machine learning experts need to analyze classification results for a large number of labeled samples to find possible reasons for incorrect classification. Confusion matrices are widely used for this purpose. However, they provide no information about classification scores and features computed for the samples. We propose a set of integrated visual methods for analyzing the performance of probabilistic classifiers. Our methods provide insight into different aspects of the classification results for a large number of samples. One visualization emphasizes at which probabilities these samples were classified and how these probabilities correlate with classification error in terms of false positives and false negatives. Another view emphasizes the features of these samples and ranks them by their separation power between selected true and false classifications. We demonstrate the insight gained using our technique in a benchmarking classification dataset, and show how it enables improving classification performance by interactively defining and evaluating post- classification rules.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346660
Adaptive Processing and Refinement,VAST,2014,INFUSE: Interactive Feature Selection for Predictive Modeling of High Dimensional Data,"Predictive modeling techniques are increasingly being used by data scientists to understand the probability of predicted outcomes. However, for data that is high-dimensional, a critical step in predictive modeling is determining which features should be included in the models. Feature selection algorithms are often used to remove non- informative features from models. However, there are many different classes of feature selection algorithms. Deciding which one to use is problematic as the algorithmic output is often not amenable to user interpretation. This limits the ability for users to utilize their domain expertise during the modeling process. To improve on this limitation, we developed INFUSE, a novel visual analytics system designed to help analysts understand how predictive features are being ranked across feature selection algorithms, cross-validation folds, and classifiers. We demonstrate how our system can lead to important insights in a case study involving clinical researchers predicting patient outcomes from electronic medical records.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346482
Adaptive Processing and Refinement,VAST,2014,Integrating predictive analytics and social media - IEEE Conference Publication,"A key analytical task across many domains is model building and exploration for predictive analysis. Data is collected, parsed and analyzed for relationships, and features are selected and mapped to estimate the response of a system under exploration. As social media data has grown more abundant, data can be captured that may potentially represent behavioral patterns in society. In turn, this unstructured social media data can be parsed and integrated as a key factor for predictive intelligence. In this paper, we present a framework for the development of predictive models utilizing social media data. We combine feature selection mechanisms, similarity comparisons and model cross-validation through a variety of interactive visualizations to support analysts in model building and prediction. In order to explore how predictions might be performed in such a framework, we present results from a user study focusing on social media data as a predictor for movie box-office success.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2014.7042495
Adaptive Processing and Refinement,VAST,2013,A Partition-Based Framework for Building and Validating Regression Models,"Regression models play a key role in many application domains for analyzing or predicting a quantitative dependent variable based on one or more independent variables. Automated approaches for building regression models are typically limited with respect to incorporating domain knowledge in the process of selecting input variables (also known as feature subset selection). Other limitations include the identification of local structures, transformations, and interactions between variables. The contribution of this paper is a framework for building regression models addressing these limitations. The framework combines a qualitative analysis of relationship structures by visualization and a quantification of relevance for ranking any number of features and pairs of features which may be categorical or continuous. A central aspect is the local approximation of the conditional target distribution by partitioning 1D and 2D feature domains into disjoint regions. This enables a visual investigation of local patterns and largely avoids structural assumptions for the quantitative ranking. We describe how the framework supports different tasks in model building (e.g., validation and comparison), and we present an interactive workflow for feature subset selection. A real-world case study illustrates the step-wise identification of a five-dimensional model for natural gas consumption. We also report feedback from domain experts after two months of deployment in the energy sector, indicating a significant effort reduction for building and improving regression models.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2013.125
Adaptive Processing and Refinement,VAST,2012,"Just-in-time annotation of clusters, outliers, and trends in point-based data visualizations - IEEE Conference Publication","We introduce the concept of just-in-time descriptive analytics as a novel application of computational and statistical techniques performed at interaction-time to help users easily understand the structure of data as seen in visualizations. Fundamental to just-intime descriptive analytics is (a) identifying visual features, such as clusters, outliers, and trends, user might observe in visualizations automatically, (b) determining the semantics of such features by performing statistical analysis as the user is interacting, and (c) enriching visualizations with annotations that not only describe semantics of visual features but also facilitate interaction to support high-level understanding of data. In this paper, we demonstrate just-in-time descriptive analytics applied to a point-based multi-dimensional visualization technique to identify and describe clusters, outliers, and trends. We argue that it provides a novel user experience of computational techniques working alongside of users allowing them to build faster qualitative mental models of data by demonstrating its application on a few use-cases. Techniques used to facilitate just-in-time descriptive analytics are described in detail along with their runtime performance characteristics. We believe this is just a starting point and much remains to be researched, as we discuss open issues and opportunities in improving accessibility and collaboration.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2012.6400487

In our paper we introduce a new method that complements them by allowing an infinite- time-evaluation of steady planar vector fields. Our algorithm unifies combinatorial and probabilistic methods and introduces the concept of separation in time-discrete Markov-Chains. We compute particle distributions instead of the streamlines of single particles. We encode the flow into a map and then into a transition matrix for each time direction. Finally, we compare the results of our grid-independent algorithm to the popular Finite-Time- Lyapunov-Exponents and discuss the discrepancies.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2012.198
Adaptive Processing and Refinement,Vis,2011,Adaptive Extraction and Quantification of Geophysical Vortices,"We consider the problem of extracting discrete two-dimensional vortices from a turbulent flow. In our approach we use a reference model describing the expected physics and geometry of an idealized vortex. The model allows us to derive a novel correlation between the size of the vortex and its strength, measured as the square of its strain minus the square of its vorticity. For vortex detection in real models we use the strength parameter to locate potential vortex cores, then measure the similarity of our ideal analytical vortex and the real vortex core for different strength thresholds. This approach provides a metric for how well a vortex core is modeled by an ideal vortex. Moreover, this provides insight into the problem of choosing the thresholds that identify a vortex. By selecting a target coefficient of determination (i.e., statistical confidence), we determine on a per-vortex basis what threshold of the strength parameter would be required to extract that vortex at the chosen confidence. We validate our approach on real data from a global ocean simulation and derive from it a map of expected vortex strengths over the global ocean.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2011.162
Adaptive Processing and Refinement,Vis,2011,Two-Dimensional Time-Dependent Vortex Regions Based on the Acceleration Magnitude,"Acceleration is a fundamental quantity of flow fields that captures Galilean invariant properties of particle motion. Considering the magnitude of this field, minima represent characteristic structures of the flow that can be classified as saddle- or vortex-like. We made the interesting observation that vortex-like minima are enclosed by particularly pronounced ridges. This makes it possible to define boundaries of vortex regions in a parameter-free way. Utilizing scalar field topology, a robust algorithm can be designed to extract such boundaries. They can be arbitrarily shaped. An efficient tracking algorithm allows us to display the temporal evolution of vortices. Various vortex models are used to evaluate the method. We apply our method to two-dimensional model systems from computational fluid dynamics and compare the results to those arising from existing definitions.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2011.249
Adaptive Processing and Refinement,Vis,2010,Interactive Separating Streak Surfaces,"Streak surfaces are among the most important features to support 3D unsteady flow exploration, but they are also among the computationally most demanding. Furthermore, to enable a feature driven analysis of the flow, one is mainly interested in streak surfaces that show separation profiles and thus detect unstable manifolds in the flow. The computation of such separation surfaces requires to place seeding structures at the separation locations and to let the structures move correspondingly to these locations in the unsteady flow. Since only little knowledge exists about the time evolution of separating streak surfaces, at this time, an automated exploration of 3D unsteady flows using such surfaces is not feasible. Therefore, in this paper we present an interactive approach for the visual analysis of separating streak surfaces. Our method draws upon recent work on the extraction of Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS) and the real-time visualization of streak surfaces on the GPU. We propose an interactive technique for computing ridges in the finite time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) field at each time step, and we use these ridges as seeding structures to track streak surfaces in the time-varying flow. By showing separation surfaces in combination with particle trajectories, and by letting the user interactively change seeding parameters such as particle density and position, visually guided exploration of separation profiles in 3D is provided. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the reconstruction and display of semantic separable surfaces in 3D unsteady flows can be performed interactively, giving rise to new possibilities for gaining insight into complex flow phenomena.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2010.169
Adaptive Processing and Refinement,Vis,2010,Interactive Vector Field Feature Identification,"We introduce a flexible technique for interactive exploration of vector field data through classification derived from user-specified feature templates. Our method is founded on the observation that, while similar features within the vector field may be spatially disparate, they share similar neighborhood characteristics. Users generate feature-based visualizations by interactively highlighting well- accepted and domain specific representative feature points. Feature exploration begins with the computation of attributes that describe the neighborhood of each sample within the input vector field. Compilation of these attributes forms a representation of the vector field samples in the attribute space. We project the attribute points onto the canonical 2D plane to enable interactive exploration of the vector field using a painting interface. The projection encodes the similarities between vector field points within the distances computed between their associated attribute points. The proposed method is performed at interactive rates for enhanced user experience and is completely flexible as showcased by the simultaneous identification of diverse feature types.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2010.170
Adaptive Processing and Refinement,Vis,2010,Streak Lines as Tangent Curves of a Derived Vector Field,"Characteristic curves of vector fields include stream, path, and streak lines. Stream and path lines can be obtained by a simple vector field integration of an autonomous ODE system, i.e., they can be described as tangent curves of a vector field. This facilitates their mathematical analysis including the extraction of core lines around which stream or path lines exhibit swirling motion, or the computation of their curvature for every point in the domain without actually integrating them. Such a description of streak lines is not yet available, which excludes them from most of the feature extraction and analysis tools that have been developed in our community. In this paper, we develop the first description of streak lines as tangent curves of a derived vector field - the streak line vector field - and show how it can be computed from the spatial and temporal gradients of the flow map, i.e., a dense path line integration is required. We demonstrate the high accuracy of our approach by comparing it to solutions where the ground truth is analytically known and to solutions where the ground truth has been obtained using the classic streak line computation. Furthermore, we apply a number of feature extraction and analysis tools to the new streak line vector field including the extraction of cores of swirling streak lines and the computation of streak line curvature fields. These first applications foreshadow the large variety of possible future research directions based on our new mathematical description of streak lines.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2010.198
Adaptive Processing and Refinement,Vis,2009,Predictor-Corrector Schemes for Visualization ofSmoothed Particle Hydrodynamics Data,"In this paper we present a method for vortex core line extraction which operates directly on the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) representation and, by this, generates smoother and more (spatially and temporally) coherent results in an efficient way. The underlying predictor-corrector scheme is general enough to be applied to other line-type features and it is extendable to the extraction of surfaces such as isosurfaces or Lagrangian coherent structures. The proposed method exploits temporal coherence to speed up computation for subsequent time steps. We show how the predictor-corrector formulation can be specialized for several variants of vortex core line definitions including two recent unsteady extensions, and we contribute a theoretical and practical comparison of these. In particular, we reveal a close relation between unsteady extensions of Fuchs et al. and Weinkauf et al. and we give a proof of the Galilean invariance of the latter. When visualizing SPH data, there is the possibility to use the same interpolation method for visualization as has been used for the simulation. This is different from the case of finite volume simulation results, where it is not possible to recover from the results the spatial interpolation that was used during the simulation. Such data are typically interpolated using the basic trilinear interpolant, and if smoothness is required, some artificial processing is added. In SPH data, however, the smoothing kernels are specified from the simulation, and they provide an exact and smooth interpolation of data or gradients at arbitrary points in the domain.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2009.173

The intrinsic geometry of a surface is diffused by means of the Ricci flow for the generation of a geometric scale space. We rigorously prove that this multiscale shape representation satisfies the axiomatic causality property. Within the theoretical framework, we further present a feature-based shape representation derived from IGSS processing, which is shown to be theoretically plausible and practically effective. By integrating the concept of scale-dependent saliency into the shape description, this representation is not only highly descriptive of the local structures, but also exhibits several desired characteristics of global shape representations, such as being compact, robust to noise and computationally efficient. We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach through salient geometric feature detection and highly discriminative matching of 3D scans.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2009.159
Adaptive Processing and Refinement,Vis,2007,Texture-based feature tracking for effective time-varying data visualization,"Analyzing, visualizing, and illustrating changes within time-varying volumetric data is challenging due to the dynamic changes occurring between timesteps. The changes and variations in computational fluid dynamic volumes and atmospheric 3D datasets do not follow any particular transformation. Features within the data move at different speeds and directions making the tracking and visualization of these features a difficult task. We introduce a texture-based feature tracking technique to overcome some of the current limitations found in the illustration and visualization of dynamic changes within time-varying volumetric data. Our texture-based technique tracks various features individually and then uses the tracked objects to better visualize structural changes. We show the effectiveness of our texture-based tracking technique with both synthetic and real world time-varying data. Furthermore, we highlight the specific visualization, annotation, registration, and feature isolation benefits of our technique. For instance, we show how our texture-based tracking can lead to insightful visualizations of time-varying data. Such visualizations, more than traditional visualization techniques, can assist domain scientists to explore and understand dynamic changes.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2007.70599

Its definition is simple and intuitive, and it has a deep theoretical foundation. While the application of this approach seems straightforward in theory, the associated computational cost is essentially prohibitive. Due to the Lagrangian nature of this technique, a huge number of particle paths must be computed to fill the space-time flow domain. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme for the adaptive computation of FTLE fields in two and three dimensions that significantly reduces the number of required particle paths. Furthermore, for three-dimensional flows, we show on several examples that meaningful results can be obtained by restricting the analysis to a well-chosen plane intersecting the flow domain. Finally, we examine some of the visualization aspects of FTLE-based methods and introduce several new variations that help in the analysis of specific aspects of a flow.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2007.70551

In this context the use of metaphors plays an important role since they make complex information easily accessible by using commonly known concepts. In this paper we propose a new metaphor, called \""topological landscapes,\"" which facilitates understanding the topological structure of scalar functions. The basic idea is to construct a terrain with the same topology as a given dataset and to display the terrain as an easily understood representation of the actual input data. In this projection from an n-dimensional scalar function to a two-dimensional (2D) model we preserve function values of critical points, the persistence (function span) of topological features, and one possible additional metric property (in our examples volume). By displaying this topologically equivalent landscape together with the original data we harness the natural human proficiency in understanding terrain topography and make complex topological information easily accessible.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2007.70601

Existing approaches identify these structures by considering the behavior of stream lines. However, in unsteady flows particle motion is described by path lines which generally gives different swirling patterns than stream lines. We introduce a novel mathematical characterization of swirling motion cores in unsteady flows by generalizing the approach of Sujudi/Haimes to path lines. The cores of swirling particle motion are lines sweeping over time, i.e., surfaces in the space-time domain. They occur at locations where three derived 4D vectors become coplanar. To extract them, we show how to re-formulate the problem using the parallel vectors operator. We apply our method to a number of unsteady flow fields.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2007.70545

This is accomplished by extending the concept of local statistical complexity from finite state cellular automata to discretized (multi-)fields. Thus, informative parts of the data can be highlighted in an application-independent, purely mathematical sense. The new measure can be applied to unsteady multifields on regular grids in any application domain.

Moment invariants have traditionally been used in computer vision applications, and we have adapted them for the purpose of interactive exploration of flow field data. The new class of moment invariants we have developed allows us to extract and visualize 2D flow patterns, invariant under translation, scaling, and rotation. With our approach one can study arbitrary flow patterns by searching a given 2D flow data set for any type of pattern as specified by a user. Further, our approach supports the computation of moments at multiple scales, facilitating fast pattern extraction and recognition. This can be done for critical point classification, but also for patterns with greater complexity. This multi-scale moment representation is also valuable for the comparative visualization of flow field data. The specific novel contributions of the work presented are the mathematical derivation of the new class of moment invariants, their analysis regarding critical point features, the efficient computation of a novel feature space representation, and based upon this the development of a fast pattern recognition algorithm for complex flow structures.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2007.70579

In order to follow these critical points and detect their transformations, affected regions of the surface are parameterized. Thus, an existing singularity tracking algorithm devised for planar settings can be applied. The trajectories of the singularities are used as a basis for seeding particles. This leads to a new type of streak line visualization, in which particles are released from a moving source. These generalized streak lines visualize the particles that are ejected from the wall.

The detected defects - also known as disclinations - are regions were the alignment of the liquid crystal rapidly changes over space; these defects play a large role in the physical behavior of the NLC substrate. Defect detection is based upon a measure of total angular change of crystal orientation (the director) over a node neighborhood via the use of a nearest neighbor path. Visualizations based upon the detection algorithm clearly identify complete defect regions as opposed to incomplete visual descriptions provided by cutting-plane and isosurface approaches.

It is present not only in vortices but also in shear flow. Especially in ducted flows, most of the overall vorticity is usually contained in the boundary layer. When a vortex develops from the boundary layer, this can be described by transport of vorticity. For a better understanding of a flow it is therefore of interest to examine vorticity in all of its different roles. The goal of this application study was not primarily the visualization of vortices but of vorticity distribution and its role in vortex phenomena. The underlying industrial case is a design optimization for a Pelton turbine. An important industrial objective is to improve the quality of the water jets driving the runner. Jet quality is affected mostly by vortices originating in the distributor ring. For a better understanding of this interrelation, it is crucial to not only visualize these vortices but also to analyze the mechanisms of their creation.

As the Rayleigh number Ra is increased the thermal field develops increasingly thin plume-like structures along which heat is convected. These eventually break down and become turbulent. Visualization methods are used to distinguish between various models of heat conductivity and to develop an intuitive understanding of the structure of the flow.,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2002.1183813

Direct extensions of the LIC method to 3D have not been considered very effective, because optical integration in viewing directions tends to spoil the coherent structures along 3D local streamlines. In our previous reports, we have proposed a selective approach to volume rendering of LIC solid texture using 3D significance map (S-map), derived from the characteristics of flow structures, and a specific illumination model for 3D streamlines. In this paper, we take full advantage of scalar volume rendering hardware, such as VolumePro, to realize a realtime 3D flow field visualization environment with the LIC volume rendering method.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2002.1183811

We extend these basic techniques to a multiresolution setting which improves the quality of the results and accelerates the extraction process. The extraction process is semi-automatic, that is, the user is required to input a few control parameters and to select the operators to be applied to the input surface. Our mesh feature extraction algorithm can be used as a preprocessor for a variety of applications in geometric modeling including mesh fairing, subdivision and simplification.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2001.964523

Next, we combine geometrical and topological considerations to derive a multiscale representation and to implement a method for the automatic placement of a sparse set of graphical primitives depicting homogeneous streams in the fields. Using the resulting algorithms, we have built a visualization system that enables us to effectively display the flow direction and its dynamics even for dense 3D fields.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2000.885688
Adaptive Processing and Refinement,Vis,2000,Extracting regions of interest applying a local watershed transformation - IEEE Conference Publication,"We present a new technique for extracting regions of interest (ROI) applying a local watershed transformation. The proposed strategy for computing catchment basins in a given region of interest is based on a rain-falling simulation. Unlike the standard watershed algorithms, which flood the complete (gradient magnitude of an) image, the proposed approach allows us to perform this task locally. Thus, a controlled region growth is performed, saving time and reducing the memory requirement especially when applied on volume data. A second problem arising from the standard watershed transformation is the over-segmented result and the lack of sound criteria for merging the computed basins. For overcoming this drawback, we present a basin-merging strategy introducing four criteria for merging adjacent basins. The threshold values applied in this strategy are derived from the user input and match rather the attributes of the selected object than of all objects in the image. In doing so, the user is not required to adjust abstract numbers, but to simply select a coarse region of interest. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is not limited to the 2D case. As we show in this work, it is suitable for volume data processing as well. Finally, we present the results of applying the proposed approach on several example images and volume data sets.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2000.885672

The central objects embodied by the tool are portraits, which show the data in various coordinate systems, while preserving their spatial connectivity and temporal variability. The coordinates are derived in various ways from the field data, and an important feature is that new and derived portraits can be created interactively. The primary operations supported by the tool are brushing and linking: the user can select a subset of a given portrait, and this subset is highlighted in all portraits. The user can combine highlighted subsets from an arbitrary number of portraits with the usual logical operators, thereby indicating where an arbitrarily complex set of conditions holds. The system is useful for exploratory visualization and feature detection in multivariate data.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1998.745289

Feature extraction is viewed as a process of data abstraction, which can proceed in multiple stages, and corresponding data abstraction levels. The features are represented by attribute sets, which play a key role in the visualization process. Icons are symbolic parametric objects, designed as visual representations of features. The attributes are mapped to the parameters (or degrees of freedom) of an icon. We describe some generic techniques to generate attribute sets, such as volume integrals and medial axis transforms. A simple but powerful modeling language was developed to create icons, and to link the attributes to the icon parameters. We present illustrative examples of iconic visualization created with the techniques described, showing the effectiveness of this approach.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1995.485141
Algorithmic pattern/feature detection/tracking,VAST,2013,Supporting Awareness through Collaborative Brushing and Linking of Tabular Data,"Maintaining an awareness of collaborators' actions is critical during collaborative work, including during collaborative visualization activities. Particularly when collaborators are located at a distance, it is important to know what everyone is working on in order to avoid duplication of effort, share relevant results in a timely manner and build upon each other's results. Can a person's brushing actions provide an indication of their queries and interests in a data set? Can these actions be revealed to a collaborator without substantially disrupting their own independent work? We designed a study to answer these questions in the context of distributed collaborative visualization of tabular data. Participants in our study worked independently to answer questions about a tabular data set, while simultaneously viewing brushing actions of a fictitious collaborator, shown directly within a shared workspace. We compared three methods of presenting the collaborator's actions: brushing & linking (i.e. highlighting exactly what the collaborator would see), selection (i.e. showing only a selected item), and persistent selection (i.e. showing only selected items but having them persist for some time). Our results demonstrated that persistent selection enabled some awareness of the collaborator's activities while causing minimal interference with independent work. Other techniques were less effective at providing awareness, and brushing & linking caused substantial interference. These findings suggest promise for the idea of exploiting natural brushing actions to provide awareness in collaborative work.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2013.197
Algorithmic pattern/feature detection/tracking,InfoVis,2011,Exploring Ambient and Artistic Visualization for Residential Energy Use Feedback,"Providing effective feedback on resource consumption in the home is a key challenge of environmental conservation efforts. One promising approach for providing feedback about residential energy consumption is the use of ambient and artistic visualizations. Pervasive computing technologies enable the integration of such feedback into the home in the form of distributed point-of-consumption feedback devices to support decision-making in everyday activities. However, introducing these devices into the home requires sensitivity to the domestic context. In this paper we describe three abstract visualizations and suggest four design requirements that this type of device must meet to be effective: pragmatic, aesthetic, ambient, and ecological. We report on the findings from a mixed methods user study that explores the viability of using ambient and artistic feedback in the home based on these requirements. Our findings suggest that this approach is a viable way to provide resource use feedback and that both the aesthetics of the representation and the context of use are important elements that must be considered in this design space.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2011.196
Algorithmic pattern/feature detection/tracking,InfoVis,2007,Casual Information Visualization: Depictions of Data in Everyday Life,"Information visualization has often focused on providing deep insight for expert user populations and on techniques for amplifying cognition through complicated interactive visual models. This paper proposes a new subdomain for infovis research that complements the focus on analytic tasks and expert use. Instead of work-related and analytically driven infovis, we propose casual information visualization (or casual infovis) as a complement to more traditional infovis domains. Traditional infovis systems, techniques, and methods do not easily lend themselves to the broad range of user populations, from expert to novices, or from work tasks to more everyday situations. We propose definitions, perspectives, and research directions for further investigations of this emerging subfield. These perspectives build from ambient information visualization (Skog et al., 2003), social visualization, and also from artistic work that visualizes information (Viegas and Wattenberg, 2007). We seek to provide a perspective on infovis that integrates these research agendas under a coherent vocabulary and framework for design. We enumerate the following contributions. First, we demonstrate how blurry the boundary of infovis is by examining systems that exhibit many of the putative properties of infovis systems, but perhaps would not be considered so. Second, we explore the notion of insight and how, instead of a monolithic definition of insight, there may be multiple types, each with particular characteristics. Third, we discuss design challenges for systems intended for casual audiences. Finally we conclude with challenges for system evaluation in this emerging subfield.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2007.70541
Algorithmic pattern/feature detection/tracking,InfoVis,2003,Between aesthetics and utility: designing ambient information visualizations - IEEE Conference Publication,"Unlike traditional information visualization, ambient information visualizations reside in the environment of the user rather than on the screen of a desktop computer. Currently, most dynamic information that is displayed in public places consists of text and numbers. We argue that information visualization can be employed to make such dynamic data more useful and appealing. However, visualizations intended for non-desktop spaces will have to both provide valuable information and present an attractive addition to the environment - they must strike a balance between aesthetical appeal and usefulness. To explore this, we designed a real-time visualization of bus departure times and deployed it in a public space, with about 300 potential users. To make the presentation more visually appealing, we took inspiration from a modern abstract artist. The visualization was designed in two passes. First, we did a preliminary version that was presented to and discussed with prospective users. Based on their input, we did a final design. We discuss the lessons learned in designing this and previous ambient information visualizations, including how visual art can be used as a design constraint, and how the choice of information and the placement of the display affect the visualization.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/INFVIS.2003.1249031
Ambient Visualization,InfoVis,2015,AggreSet: Rich and Scalable Set Exploration using Visualizations of Element Aggregations,"Datasets commonly include multi-value (set-typed) attributes that describe set memberships over elements, such as genres per movie or courses taken per student. Set-typed attributes describe rich relations across elements, sets, and the set intersections. Increasing the number of sets results in a combinatorial growth of relations and creates scalability challenges. Exploratory tasks (e.g. selection, comparison) have commonly been designed in separation for set-typed attributes, which reduces interface consistency. To improve on scalability and to support rich, contextual exploration of set-typed data, we present AggreSet. AggreSet creates aggregations for each data dimension: sets, set-degrees, set-pair intersections, and other attributes. It visualizes the element count per aggregate using a matrix plot for set-pair intersections, and histograms for set lists, set-degrees and other attributes. Its non-overlapping visual design is scalable to numerous and large sets. AggreSet supports selection, filtering, and comparison as core exploratory tasks. It allows analysis of set relations inluding subsets, disjoint sets and set intersection strength, and also features perceptual set ordering for detecting patterns in set matrices. Its interaction is designed for rich and rapid data exploration. We demonstrate results on a wide range of datasets from different domains with varying characteristics, and report on expert reviews and a case study using student enrollment and degree data with assistant deans at a major public university.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467051
Ambient Visualization,InfoVis,2015,Voyager: Exploratory Analysis via Faceted Browsing of Visualization Recommendations,"General visualization tools typically require manual specification of views: analysts must select data variables and then choose which transformations and visual encodings to apply. These decisions often involve both domain and visualization design expertise, and may impose a tedious specification process that impedes exploration. In this paper, we seek to complement manual chart construction with interactive navigation of a gallery of automatically-generated visualizations. We contribute Voyager, a mixed-initiative system that supports faceted browsing of recommended charts chosen according to statistical and perceptual measures. We describe Voyager's architecture, motivating design principles, and methods for generating and interacting with visualization recommendations. In a study comparing Voyager to a manual visualization specification tool, we find that Voyager facilitates exploration of previously unseen data and leads to increased data variable coverage. We then distill design implications for visualization tools, in particular the need to balance rapid exploration and targeted question- answering.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467191
Ambient Visualization,InfoVis,2015,A comparative study between RadViz and Star Coordinates,"RadViz and star coordinates are two of the most popular projection-based multivariate visualization techniques that arrange variables in radial layouts. Formally, the main difference between them consists of a nonlinear normalization step inherent in RadViz. In this paper we show that, although RadViz can be useful when analyzing sparse data, in general this design choice limits its applicability and introduces several drawbacks for exploratory data analysis. In particular, we observe that the normalization step introduces nonlinear distortions, can encumber outlier detection, prevents associating the plots with useful linear mappings, and impedes estimating original data attributes accurately. In addition, users have greater flexibility when choosing different layouts and views of the data in star coordinates. Therefore, we suggest that analysts and researchers should carefully consider whether RadViz's normalization step is beneficial regarding the data sets' characteristics and analysis tasks.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467324
Ambient Visualization,SciVis,2015,Association Analysis for Visual Exploration of Multivariate Scientific Data Sets,"The heterogeneity and complexity of multivariate characteristics poses a unique challenge to visual exploration of multivariate scientific data sets, as it requires investigating the usually hidden associations between different variables and specific scalar values to understand the data's multi-faceted properties. In this paper, we present a novel association analysis method that guides visual exploration of scalar- level associations in the multivariate context. We model the directional interactions between scalars of different variables as information flows based on association rules. We introduce the concepts of informativeness and uniqueness to describe how information flows between scalars of different variables and how they are associated with each other in the multivariate domain. Based on scalar-level associations represented by a probabilistic association graph, we propose the Multi-Scalar Informativeness-Uniqueness (MSIU) algorithm to evaluate the informativeness and uniqueness of scalars. We present an exploration framework with multiple interactive views to explore the scalars of interest with confident associations in the multivariate spatial domain, and provide guidelines for visual exploration using our framework. We demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of our approach through case studies using three representative multivariate scientific data sets.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467431
Ambient Visualization,SciVis,2015,CAST: Effective and Efficient User Interaction for Context-Aware Selection in 3D Particle Clouds,"We present a family of three interactive Context-Aware Selection Techniques (CAST) for the analysis of large 3D particle datasets. For these datasets, spatial selection is an essential prerequisite to many other analysis tasks. Traditionally, such interactive target selection has been particularly challenging when the data subsets of interest were implicitly defined in the form of complicated structures of thousands of particles. Our new techniques SpaceCast, TraceCast, and PointCast improve usability and speed of spatial selection in point clouds through novel context-aware algorithms. They are able to infer a user's subtle selection intention from gestural input, can deal with complex situations such as partially occluded point clusters or multiple cluster layers, and can all be fine-tuned after the selection interaction has been completed. Together, they provide an effective and efficient tool set for the fast exploratory analysis of large datasets. In addition to presenting Cast, we report on a formal user study that compares our new techniques not only to each other but also to existing state-of-the-art selection methods. Our results show that Cast family members are virtually always faster than existing methods without tradeoffs in accuracy. In addition, qualitative feedback shows that PointCast and TraceCast were strongly favored by our participants for intuitiveness and efficiency.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467202
Ambient Visualization,SciVis,2015,In Situ Eddy Analysis in a High-Resolution Ocean Climate Model,"An eddy is a feature associated with a rotating body of fluid, surrounded by a ring of shearing fluid. In the ocean, eddies are 10 to 150 km in diameter, are spawned by boundary currents and baroclinic instabilities, may live for hundreds of days, and travel for hundreds of kilometers. Eddies are important in climate studies because they transport heat, salt, and nutrients through the world's oceans and are vessels of biological productivity. The study of eddies in global ocean-climate models requires large-scale, high-resolution simulations. This poses a problem for feasible (timely) eddy analysis, as ocean simulations generate massive amounts of data, causing a bottleneck for traditional analysis workflows. To enable eddy studies, we have developed an in situ workflow for the quantitative and qualitative analysis of MPAS-Ocean, a high- resolution ocean climate model, in collaboration with the ocean model research and development process. Planned eddy analysis at high spatial and temporal resolutions will not be possible with a postprocessing workflow due to various constraints, such as storage size and I/O time, but the in situ workflow enables it and scales well to ten-thousand processing elements.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467411
Ambient Visualization,SciVis,2015,Reconstruction and Visualization of Coordinated 3D Cell Migration Based on Optical Flow,"Animal development is marked by the repeated reorganization of cells and cell populations, which ultimately determine form and shape of the growing organism. One of the central questions in developmental biology is to understand precisely how cells reorganize, as well as how and to what extent this reorganization is coordinated. While modern microscopes can record video data for every cell during animal development in 3D+t, analyzing these videos remains a major challenge: reconstruction of comprehensive cell tracks turned out to be very demanding especially with decreasing data quality and increasing cell densities. In this paper, we present an analysis pipeline for coordinated cellular motions in developing embryos based on the optical flow of a series of 3D images. We use numerical integration to reconstruct cellular long-term motions in the optical flow of the video, we take care of data validation, and we derive a LIC-based, dense flow visualization for the resulting pathlines. This approach allows us to handle low video quality such as noisy data or poorly separated cells, and it allows the biologists to get a comprehensive understanding of their data by capturing dynamic growth processes in stills. We validate our methods using three videos of growing fruit fly embryos.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467291
Ambient Visualization,VAST,2015,TargetVue: Visual Analysis of Anomalous User Behaviors in Online Communication Systems,"Users with anomalous behaviors in online communication systems (e.g. email and social medial platforms) are potential threats to society. Automated anomaly detection based on advanced machine learning techniques has been developed to combat this issue; challenges remain, though, due to the difficulty of obtaining proper ground truth for model training and evaluation. Therefore, substantial human judgment on the automated analysis results is often required to better adjust the performance of anomaly detection. Unfortunately, techniques that allow users to understand the analysis results more efficiently, to make a confident judgment about anomalies, and to explore data in their context, are still lacking. In this paper, we propose a novel visual analysis system, TargetVue, which detects anomalous users via an unsupervised learning model and visualizes the behaviors of suspicious users in behavior-rich context through novel visualization designs and multiple coordinated contextual views. Particularly, TargetVue incorporates three new ego-centric glyphs to visually summarize a user's behaviors which effectively present the user's communication activities, features, and social interactions. An efficient layout method is proposed to place these glyphs on a triangle grid, which captures similarities among users and facilitates comparisons of behaviors of different users. We demonstrate the power of TargetVue through its application in a social bot detection challenge using Twitter data, a case study based on email records, and an interview with expert users. Our evaluation shows that TargetVue is beneficial to the detection of users with anomalous communication behaviors.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467196
Ambient Visualization,VAST,2015,Visually Exploring Transportation Schedules,"Public transportation schedules are designed by agencies to optimize service quality under multiple constraints. However, real service usually deviates from the plan. Therefore, transportation analysts need to identify, compare and explain both eventual and systemic performance issues that must be addressed so that better timetables can be created. The purely statistical tools commonly used by analysts pose many difficulties due to the large number of attributes at tripand station-level for planned and real service. Also challenging is the need for models at multiple scales to search for patterns at different times and stations, since analysts do not know exactly where or when relevant patterns might emerge and need to compute statistical summaries for multiple attributes at different granularities. To aid in this analysis, we worked in close collaboration with a transportation expert to design TR-EX, a visual exploration tool developed to identify, inspect and compare spatio-temporal patterns for planned and real transportation service. TR-EX combines two new visual encodings inspired by Marey's Train Schedule: Trips Explorer for trip-level analysis of frequency, deviation and speed; and Stops Explorer for station-level study of delay, wait time, reliability and performance deficiencies such as bunching. To tackle overplotting and to provide a robust representation for a large numbers of trips and stops at multiple scales, the system supports variable kernel bandwidths to achieve the level of detail required by users for different tasks. We justify our design decisions based on specific analysis needs of transportation analysts. We provide anecdotal evidence of the efficacy of TR- EX through a series of case studies that explore NYC subway service, which illustrate how TR-EX can be used to confirm hypotheses and derive new insights through visual exploration.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467592
Ambient Visualization,VAST,2015,Reducing Snapshots to Points: A Visual Analytics Approach to Dynamic Network Exploration,"We propose a visual analytics approach for the exploration and analysis of dynamic networks. We consider snapshots of the network as points in high-dimensional space and project these to two dimensions for visualization and interaction using two juxtaposed views: one for showing a snapshot and one for showing the evolution of the network. With this approach users are enabled to detect stable states, recurring states, outlier topologies, and gain knowledge about the transitions between states and the network evolution in general. The components of our approach are discretization, vectorization and normalization, dimensionality reduction, and visualization and interaction, which are discussed in detail. The effectiveness of the approach is shown by applying it to artificial and real-world dynamic networks.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2468078
Ambient Visualization,VAST,2015,Collaborative visual analysis with RCloud - IEEE Conference Publication,"Consider the emerging role of data science teams embedded in larger organizations. Individual analysts work on loosely related problems, and must share their findings with each other and the organization at large, moving results from exploratory data analyses (EDA) into automated visualizations, diagnostics and reports deployed for wider consumption. There are two problems with the current practice. First, there are gaps in this workflow: EDA is performed with one set of tools, and automated reports and deployments with another. Second, these environments often assume a single- developer perspective, while data scientist teams could get much benefit from easier sharing of scripts and data feeds, experiments, annotations, and automated recommendations, which are well beyond what traditional version control systems provide. We contribute and justify the following three requirements for systems built to support current data science teams and users: discoverability, technology transfer, and coexistence. In addition, we contribute the design and implementation of RCloud, a system that supports the requirements of collaborative data analysis, visualization and web deployment. About 100 people used RCloud for two years. We report on interviews with some of these users, and discuss design decisions, tradeoffs and limitations in comparison to other approaches.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2015.7347627
Ambient Visualization,InfoVis,2014,Design Activity Framework for Visualization Design,"An important aspect in visualization design is the connection between what a designer does and the decisions the designer makes. Existing design process models, however, do not explicitly link back to models for visualization design decisions. We bridge this gap by introducing the design activity framework, a process model that explicitly connects to the nested model, a well-known visualization design decision model. The framework includes four overlapping activities that characterize the design process, with each activity explicating outcomes related to the nested model. Additionally, we describe and characterize a list of exemplar methods and how they overlap among these activities. The design activity framework is the result of reflective discussions from a collaboration on a visualization redesign project, the details of which we describe to ground the framework in a real-world design process. Lastly, from this redesign project we provide several research outcomes in the domain of cybersecurity, including an extended data abstraction and rich opportunities for future visualization research.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346331
Ambient Visualization,InfoVis,2014,The Effects of Interactive Latency on Exploratory Visual Analysis,"To support effective exploration, it is often stated that interactive visualizations should provide rapid response times. However, the effects of interactive latency on the process and outcomes of exploratory visual analysis have not been systematically studied. We present an experiment measuring user behavior and knowledge discovery with interactive visualizations under varying latency conditions. We observe that an additional delay of 500ms incurs significant costs, decreasing user activity and data set coverage. Analyzing verbal data from think-aloud protocols, we find that increased latency reduces the rate at which users make observations, draw generalizations and generate hypotheses. Moreover, we note interaction effects in which initial exposure to higher latencies leads to subsequently reduced performance in a low-latency setting. Overall, increased latency causes users to shift exploration strategy, in turn affecting performance. We discuss how these results can inform the design of interactive analysis tools.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346452
Ambient Visualization,SciVis,2014,Using Topological Analysis to Support Event-Guided Exploration in Urban Data,"The explosion in the volume of data about urban environments has opened up opportunities to inform both policy and administration and thereby help governments improve the lives of their citizens, increase the efficiency of public services, and reduce the environmental harms of development. However, cities are complex systems and exploring the data they generate is challenging. The interaction between the various components in a city creates complex dynamics where interesting facts occur at multiple scales, requiring users to inspect a large number of data slices over time and space. Manual exploration of these slices is ineffective, time consuming, and in many cases impractical. In this paper, we propose a technique that supports event-guided exploration of large, spatio-temporal urban data. We model the data as time-varying scalar functions and use computational topology to automatically identify events in different data slices. To handle a potentially large number of events, we develop an algorithm to group and index them, thus allowing users to interactively explore and query event patterns on the fly. A visual exploration interface helps guide users towards data slices that display interesting events and trends. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique on two different data sets from New York City (NYC): data about taxi trips and subway service. We also report on the feedback we received from analysts at different NYC agencies.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346449
Ambient Visualization,SciVis,2014,Conforming Morse-Smale Complexes,"Morse-Smale (MS) complexes have been gaining popularity as a tool for feature-driven data analysis and visualization. However, the quality of their geometric embedding and the sole dependence on the input scalar field data can limit their applicability when expressing application- dependent features. In this paper we introduce a new combinatorial technique to compute an MS complex that conforms to both an input scalar field and an additional, prior segmentation of the domain. The segmentation constrains the MS complex computation guaranteeing that boundaries in the segmentation are captured as separatrices of the MS complex. We demonstrate the utility and versatility of our approach with two applications. First, we use streamline integration to determine numerically computed basins/mountains and use the resulting segmentation as an input to our algorithm. This strategy enables the incorporation of prior flow path knowledge, effectively resulting in an MS complex that is as geometrically accurate as the employed numerical integration. Our second use case is motivated by the observation that often the data itself does not explicitly contain features known to be present by a domain expert. We introduce edit operations for MS complexes so that a user can directly modify their features while maintaining all the advantages of a robust topology-based representation.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346434

In this paper, we present a novel representation of contours with the aim of studying the similarity relationship between the contours. The representation maps contours to points in a high-dimensional transformation-invariant descriptor space. We leverage the power of this representation to design a clustering based algorithm for detecting symmetric regions in a scalar field. Symmetry detection is a challenging problem because it demands both segmentation of the data and identification of transformation invariant segments. While the former task can be addressed using topological analysis of scalar fields, the latter requires geometry based solutions. Our approach combines the two by utilizing the contour tree for segmenting the data and the descriptor space for determining transformation invariance. We discuss two applications, query driven exploration and asymmetry visualization, that demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346332
Ambient Visualization,SciVis,2014,Interactive Progressive Visualization with Space-Time Error Control,"We present a novel scheme for progressive rendering in interactive visualization. Static settings with respect to a certain image quality or frame rate are inherently incapable of delivering both high frame rates for rapid changes and high image quality for detailed investigation. Our novel technique flexibly adapts by steering the visualization process in three major degrees of freedom: when to terminate the refinement of a frame in the background and start a new one, when to display a frame currently computed, and how much resources to consume. We base these decisions on the correlation of the errors due to insufficient sampling and response delay, which we estimate separately using fast yet expressive heuristics. To automate the configuration of the steering behavior, we employ offline video quality analysis. We provide an efficient implementation of our scheme for the application of volume raycasting, featuring integrated GPU-accelerated image reconstruction and error estimation. Our implementation performs an integral handling of the changes due to camera transforms, transfer function adaptations, as well as the progression of the data to in time. Finally, the overall technique is evaluated with an expert study.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346319
Ambient Visualization,VAST,2014,ConTour: Data-Driven Exploration of Multi-Relational Datasets for Drug Discovery,"Large scale data analysis is nowadays a crucial part of drug discovery. Biologists and chemists need to quickly explore and evaluate potentially effective yet safe compounds based on many datasets that are in relationship with each other. However, there is a lack of tools that support them in these processes. To remedy this, we developed ConTour, an interactive visual analytics technique that enables the exploration of these complex, multi-relational datasets. At its core ConTour lists all items of each dataset in a column. Relationships between the columns are revealed through interaction: selecting one or multiple items in one column highlights and re-sorts the items in other columns. Filters based on relationships enable drilling down into the large data space. To identify interesting items in the first place, ConTour employs advanced sorting strategies, including strategies based on connectivity strength and uniqueness, as well as sorting based on item attributes. ConTour also introduces interactive nesting of columns, a powerful method to show the related items of a child column for each item in the parent column. Within the columns, ConTour shows rich attribute data about the items as well as information about the connection strengths to other datasets. Finally, ConTour provides a number of detail views, which can show items from multiple datasets and their associated data at the same time. We demonstrate the utility of our system in case studies conducted with a team of chemical biologists, who investigate the effects of chemical compounds on cells and need to understand the underlying mechanisms.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346752
Ambient Visualization,VAST,2014,Progressive Visual Analytics: User-Driven Visual Exploration of In-Progress Analytics,"As datasets grow and analytic algorithms become more complex, the typical workflow of analysts launching an analytic, waiting for it to complete, inspecting the results, and then re-Iaunching the computation with adjusted parameters is not realistic for many real-world tasks. This paper presents an alternative workflow, progressive visual analytics, which enables an analyst to inspect partial results of an algorithm as they become available and interact with the algorithm to prioritize subspaces of interest. Progressive visual analytics depends on adapting analytical algorithms to produce meaningful partial results and enable analyst intervention without sacrificing computational speed. The paradigm also depends on adapting information visualization techniques to incorporate the constantly refining results without overwhelming analysts and provide interactions to support an analyst directing the analytic. The contributions of this paper include: a description of the progressive visual analytics paradigm; design goals for both the algorithms and visualizations in progressive visual analytics systems; an example progressive visual analytics system (Progressive Insights) for analyzing common patterns in a collection of event sequences; and an evaluation of Progressive Insights and the progressive visual analytics paradigm by clinical researchers analyzing electronic medical records.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346574
Ambient Visualization,VAST,2014,Opening the Black Box: Strategies for Increased User Involvement in Existing Algorithm Implementations,"An increasing number of interactive visualization tools stress the integration with computational software like MATLAB and R to access a variety of proven algorithms. In many cases, however, the algorithms are used as black boxes that run to completion in isolation which contradicts the needs of interactive data exploration. This paper structures, formalizes, and discusses possibilities to enable user involvement in ongoing computations. Based on a structured characterization of needs regarding intermediate feedback and control, the main contribution is a formalization and comparison of strategies for achieving user involvement for algorithms with different characteristics. In the context of integration, we describe considerations for implementing these strategies either as part of the visualization tool or as part of the algorithm, and we identify requirements and guidelines for the design of algorithmic APIs. To assess the practical applicability, we provide a survey of frequently used algorithm implementations within R regarding the fulfillment of these guidelines. While echoing previous calls for analysis modules which support data exploration more directly, we conclude that a range of pragmatic options for enabling user involvement in ongoing computations exists on both the visualization and algorithm side and should be used.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346578
Ambient Visualization,VAST,2014,YMCA -- Your mesh comparison application - IEEE Conference Publication,"Polygonal meshes can be created in several different ways. In this paper we focus on the reconstruction of meshes from point clouds, which are sets of points in 3D. Several algorithms that tackle this task already exist, but they have different benefits and drawbacks, which leads to a large number of possible reconstruction results (i.e., meshes). The evaluation of those techniques requires extensive comparisons between different meshes which is up to now done by either placing images of rendered meshes side-by-side, or by encoding differences by heat maps. A major drawback of both approaches is that they do not scale well with the number of meshes. This paper introduces a new comparative visual analysis technique for 3D meshes which enables the simultaneous comparison of several meshes and allows for the interactive exploration of their differences. Our approach gives an overview of the differences of the input meshes in a 2D view. By selecting certain areas of interest, the user can switch to a 3D representation and explore the spatial differences in detail. To inspect local variations, we provide a magic lens tool in 3D. The location and size of the lens provide further information on the variations of the reconstructions in the selected area. With our comparative visualization approach, differences between several mesh reconstruction algorithms can be easily localized and inspected.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2014.7042491
Ambient Visualization,VAST,2014,A visual reasoning approach for data-driven transport assessment on urban roads - IEEE Conference Publication,"Transport assessment plays a vital role in urban planning and traffic control, which are influenced by multi-faceted traffic factors involving road infrastructure and traffic flow. Conventional solutions can hardly meet the requirements and expectations of domain experts. In this paper we present a data-driven solution by leveraging a visual analysis system to evaluate the real traffic situations based on taxi trajectory data. A sketch-based visual interface is designed to support dynamic query and visual reasoning of traffic situations within multiple coordinated views. In particular, we propose a novel road-based query model for analysts to interactively conduct evaluation tasks. This model is supported by a bi-directional hash structure, TripHash, which enables real- time responses to the data queries over a huge amount of trajectory data. Case studies with a real taxi GPS trajectory dataset (> 30GB) show that our system performs well for on-demand transport assessment and reasoning.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2014.7042486
Ambient Visualization,InfoVis,2013,Understanding Interfirm Relationships in Business Ecosystems with Interactive Visualization,"Business ecosystems are characterized by large, complex, and global networks of firms, often from many different market segments, all collaborating, partnering, and competing to create and deliver new products and services. Given the rapidly increasing scale, complexity, and rate of change of business ecosystems, as well as economic and competitive pressures, analysts are faced with the formidable task of quickly understanding the fundamental characteristics of these interfirm networks. Existing tools, however, are predominantly query- or list- centric with limited interactive, exploratory capabilities. Guided by a field study of corporate analysts, we have designed and implemented dotlink360, an interactive visualization system that provides capabilities to gain systemic insight into the compositional, temporal, and connective characteristics of business ecosystems. dotlink360 consists of novel, multiple connected views enabling the analyst to explore, discover, and understand interfirm networks for a focal firm, specific market segments or countries, and the entire business ecosystem. System evaluation by a small group of prototypical users shows supporting evidence of the benefits of our approach. This design study contributes to the relatively unexplored, but promising area of exploratory information visualization in market research and business strategy.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2013.209
Ambient Visualization,VAST,2013,Explainers: Expert Explorations with Crafted Projections,"This paper introduces an approach to exploration and discovery in high-dimensional data that incorporates a user's knowledge and questions to craft sets of projection functions meaningful to them. Unlike most prior work that defines projections based on their statistical properties, our approach creates projection functions that align with user-specified annotations. Therefore, the resulting derived dimensions represent concepts defined by the user's examples. These especially crafted projection functions, or explainers, can help find and explain relationships between the data variables and user-designated concepts. They can organize the data according to these concepts. Sets of explainers can provide multiple perspectives on the data. Our approach considers tradeoffs in choosing these projection functions, including their simplicity, expressive power, alignment with prior knowledge, and diversity. We provide techniques for creating collections of explainers. The methods, based on machine learning optimization frameworks, allow exploring the tradeoffs. We demonstrate our approach on model problems and applications in text analysis.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2013.157
Ambient Visualization,VAST,2013,Visual Analysis of Topic Competition on Social Media,"How do various topics compete for public attention when they are spreading on social media? What roles do opinion leaders play in the rise and fall of competitiveness of various topics? In this study, we propose an expanded topic competition model to characterize the competition for public attention on multiple topics promoted by various opinion leaders on social media. To allow an intuitive understanding of the estimated measures, we present a timeline visualization through a metaphoric interpretation of the results. The visual design features both topical and social aspects of the information diffusion process by compositing ThemeRiver with storyline style visualization. ThemeRiver shows the increase and decrease of competitiveness of each topic. Opinion leaders are drawn as threads that converge or diverge with regard to their roles in influencing the public agenda change over time. To validate the effectiveness of the visual analysis techniques, we report the insights gained on two collections of Tweets: the 2012 United States presidential election and the Occupy Wall Street movement.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2013.221
Ambient Visualization,VAST,2013,MotionExplorer: Exploratory Search in Human Motion Capture Data Based on Hierarchical Aggregation,"We present MotionExplorer, an exploratory search and analysis system for sequences of human motion in large motion capture data collections. This special type of multivariate time series data is relevant in many research fields including medicine, sports and animation. Key tasks in working with motion data include analysis of motion states and transitions, and synthesis of motion vectors by interpolation and combination. In the practice of research and application of human motion data, challenges exist in providing visual summaries and drill- down functionality for handling large motion data collections. We find that this domain can benefit from appropriate visual retrieval and analysis support to handle these tasks in presence of large motion data. To address this need, we developed MotionExplorer together with domain experts as an exploratory search system based on interactive aggregation and visualization of motion states as a basis for data navigation, exploration, and search. Based on an overview-first type visualization, users are able to search for interesting sub-sequences of motion based on a query-by-example metaphor, and explore search results by details on demand. We developed MotionExplorer in close collaboration with the targeted users who are researchers working on human motion synthesis and analysis, including a summative field study. Additionally, we conducted a laboratory design study to substantially improve MotionExplorer towards an intuitive, usable and robust design. MotionExplorer enables the search in human motion capture data with only a few mouse clicks. The researchers unanimously confirm that the system can efficiently support their work.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2013.178
Ambient Visualization,VAST,2013,Using Interactive Visual Reasoning to Support Sense-Making: Implications for Design,"This research aims to develop design guidelines for systems that support investigators and analysts in the exploration and assembly of evidence and inferences. We focus here on the problem of identifying candidate 'influencers' within a community of practice. To better understand this problem and its related cognitive and interaction needs, we conducted a user study using a system called INVISQUE (INteractive Visual Search and QUery Environment) loaded with content from the ACM Digital Library. INVISQUE supports search and manipulation of results over a freeform infinite 'canvas'. The study focuses on the representations user create and their reasoning process. It also draws on some pre-established theories and frameworks related to sense-making and cognitive work in general, which we apply as a 'theoretical lenses' to consider findings and articulate solutions. Analysing the user-study data in the light of these provides some understanding of how the high-level problem of identifying key players within a domain can translate into lower-level questions and interactions. This, in turn, has informed our understanding of representation and functionality needs at a level of description which abstracts away from the specifics of the problem at hand to the class of problems of interest. We consider the study outcomes from the perspective of implications for design.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2013.211
Ambient Visualization,VAST,2013,Visual Exploration of Big Spatio-Temporal Urban Data: A Study of New York City Taxi Trips,"As increasing volumes of urban data are captured and become available, new opportunities arise for data-driven analysis that can lead to improvements in the lives of citizens through evidence-based decision making and policies. In this paper, we focus on a particularly important urban data set: taxi trips. Taxis are valuable sensors and information associated with taxi trips can provide unprecedented insight into many different aspects of city life, from economic activity and human behavior to mobility patterns. But analyzing these data presents many challenges. The data are complex, containing geographical and temporal components in addition to multiple variables associated with each trip. Consequently, it is hard to specify exploratory queries and to perform comparative analyses (e.g., compare different regions over time). This problem is compounded due to the size of the data-there are on average 500,000 taxi trips each day in NYC. We propose a new model that allows users to visually query taxi trips. Besides standard analytics queries, the model supports origin-destination queries that enable the study of mobility across the city. We show that this model is able to express a wide range of spatio-temporal queries, and it is also flexible in that not only can queries be composed but also different aggregations and visual representations can be applied, allowing users to explore and compare results. We have built a scalable system that implements this model which supports interactive response times; makes use of an adaptive level-of-detail rendering strategy to generate clutter-free visualization for large results; and shows hidden details to the users in a summary through the use of overlay heat maps. We present a series of case studies motivated by traffic engineers and economists that show how our model and system enable domain experts to perform tasks that were previously unattainable for them.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2013.226
Ambient Visualization,Vis,2013,Detecting Symmetry in Scalar Fields Using Augmented Extremum Graphs,Visualizing symmetric patterns in the data often helps the domain scientists make important observations and gain insights about the underlying experiment. Detecting symmetry in scalar fields is a nascent area of research and existing methods that detect symmetry are either not robust in the presence of noise or computationally costly. We propose a data structure called the augmented extremum graph and use it to design a novel symmetry detection method based on robust estimation of distances. The augmented extremum graph captures both topological and geometric information of the scalar field and enables robust and computationally efficient detection of symmetry. We apply the proposed method to detect symmetries in cryo-electron microscopy datasets and the experiments demonstrate that the algorithm is capable of detecting symmetry even in the presence of significant noise. We describe novel applications that use the detected symmetry to enhance visualization of scalar field data and facilitate their exploration.,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2013.148
Ambient Visualization,InfoVis,2012,Understanding Pen and Touch Interaction for Data Exploration on Interactive Whiteboards,"Current interfaces for common information visualizations such as bar graphs, line graphs, and scatterplots usually make use of the WIMP (Windows, Icons, Menus and a Pointer) interface paradigm with its frequently discussed problems of multiple levels of indirection via cascading menus, dialog boxes, and control panels. Recent advances in interface capabilities such as the availability of pen and touch interaction challenge us to re-think this and investigate more direct access to both the visualizations and the data they portray. We conducted a Wizard of Oz study to explore applying pen and touch interaction to the creation of information visualization interfaces on interactive whiteboards without implementing a plethora of recognizers. Our wizard acted as a robust and flexible pen and touch recognizer, giving participants maximum freedom in how they interacted with the system. Based on our qualitative analysis of the interactions our participants used, we discuss our insights about pen and touch interactions in the context of learnability and the interplay between pen and touch gestures. We conclude with suggestions for designing pen and touch enabled interactive visualization interfaces.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2012.275
Ambient Visualization,InfoVis,2012,PivotPaths: Strolling through Faceted Information Spaces,"We present PivotPaths, an interactive visualization for exploring faceted information resources. During both work and leisure, we increasingly interact with information spaces that contain multiple facets and relations, such as authors, keywords, and citations of academic publications, or actors and genres of movies. To navigate these interlinked resources today, one typically selects items from facet lists resulting in abrupt changes from one subset of data to another. While filtering is useful to retrieve results matching specific criteria, it can be difficult to see how facets and items relate and to comprehend the effect of filter operations. In contrast, the PivotPaths interface exposes faceted relations as visual paths in arrangements that invite the viewer to `take a stroll' through an information space. PivotPaths supports pivot operations as lightweight interaction techniques that trigger gradual transitions between views. We designed the interface to allow for casual traversal of large collections in an aesthetically pleasing manner that encourages exploration and serendipitous discoveries. This paper shares the findings from our iterative design-and-evaluation process that included semi- structured interviews and a two-week deployment of PivotPaths applied to a large database of academic publications.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2012.252
Ambient Visualization,InfoVis,2012,Stacking-Based Visualization of Trajectory Attribute Data,"Visualizing trajectory attribute data is challenging because it involves showing the trajectories in their spatio-temporal context as well as the attribute values associated with the individual points of trajectories. Previous work on trajectory visualization addresses selected aspects of this problem, but not all of them. We present a novel approach to visualizing trajectory attribute data. Our solution covers space, time, and attribute values. Based on an analysis of relevant visualization tasks, we designed the visualization solution around the principle of stacking trajectory bands. The core of our approach is a hybrid 2D/3D display. A 2D map serves as a reference for the spatial context, and the trajectories are visualized as stacked 3D trajectory bands along which attribute values are encoded by color. Time is integrated through appropriate ordering of bands and through a dynamic query mechanism that feeds temporally aggregated information to a circular time display. An additional 2D time graph shows temporal information in full detail by stacking 2D trajectory bands. Our solution is equipped with analytical and interactive mechanisms for selecting and ordering of trajectories, and adjusting the color mapping, as well as coordinated highlighting and dedicated 3D navigation. We demonstrate the usefulness of our novel visualization by three examples related to radiation surveillance, traffic analysis, and maritime navigation. User feedback obtained in a small experiment indicates that our hybrid 2D/3D solution can be operated quite well.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2012.265
Ambient Visualization,InfoVis,2012,Different Strokes for Different Folks: Visual Presentation Design between Disciplines,"We present an ethnographic study of design differences in visual presentations between academic disciplines. Characterizing design conventions between users and data domains is an important step in developing hypotheses, tools, and design guidelines for information visualization. In this paper, disciplines are compared at a coarse scale between four groups of fields: social, natural, and formal sciences; and the humanities. Two commonplace presentation types were analyzed: electronic slideshows and whiteboard ""chalk talks"". We found design differences in slideshows using two methods - coding and comparing manually- selected features, like charts and diagrams, and an image-based analysis using PCA called eigenslides. In whiteboard talks with controlled topics, we observed design behaviors, including using representations and formalisms from a participant's own discipline, that suggest authors might benefit from novel assistive tools for designing presentations. Based on these findings, we discuss opportunities for visualization ethnography and human-centered authoring tools for visual information.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2012.214
Ambient Visualization,VAST,2012,"Just-in-time annotation of clusters, outliers, and trends in point-based data visualizations - IEEE Conference Publication","We introduce the concept of just-in-time descriptive analytics as a novel application of computational and statistical techniques performed at interaction-time to help users easily understand the structure of data as seen in visualizations. Fundamental to just-intime descriptive analytics is (a) identifying visual features, such as clusters, outliers, and trends, user might observe in visualizations automatically, (b) determining the semantics of such features by performing statistical analysis as the user is interacting, and (c) enriching visualizations with annotations that not only describe semantics of visual features but also facilitate interaction to support high-level understanding of data. In this paper, we demonstrate just-in-time descriptive analytics applied to a point-based multi-dimensional visualization technique to identify and describe clusters, outliers, and trends. We argue that it provides a novel user experience of computational techniques working alongside of users allowing them to build faster qualitative mental models of data by demonstrating its application on a few use-cases. Techniques used to facilitate just-in-time descriptive analytics are described in detail along with their runtime performance characteristics. We believe this is just a starting point and much remains to be researched, as we discuss open issues and opportunities in improving accessibility and collaboration.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2012.6400487
Ambient Visualization,Vis,2012,Hierarchical Exploration of Volumes Using Multilevel Segmentation of the Intensity-Gradient Histograms,"Visual exploration of volumetric datasets to discover the embedded features and spatial structures is a challenging and tedious task. In this paper we present a semi-automatic approach to this problem that works by visually segmenting the intensity-gradient 2D histogram of a volumetric dataset into an exploration hierarchy. Our approach mimics user exploration behavior by analyzing the histogram with the normalized-cut multilevel segmentation technique. Unlike previous work in this area, our technique segments the histogram into a reasonable set of intuitive components that are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive. We use information-theoretic measures of the volumetric data segments to guide the exploration. This provides a data-driven coarse-to-fine hierarchy for a user to interactively navigate the volume in a meaningful manner.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2012.231
Ambient Visualization,InfoVis,2011,Exploratory Analysis of Time-Series with ChronoLenses,"Visual representations of time- series are useful for tasks such as identifying trends, patterns and anomalies in the data. Many techniques have been devised to make these visual representations more scalable, enabling the simultaneous display of multiple variables, as well as the multi-scale display of time-series of very high resolution or that span long time periods. There has been comparatively little research on how to support the more elaborate tasks associated with the exploratory visual analysis of timeseries, e.g., visualizing derived values, identifying correlations, or discovering anomalies beyond obvious outliers. Such tasks typically require deriving new time-series from the original data, trying different functions and parameters in an iterative manner. We introduce a novel visualization technique called ChronoLenses, aimed at supporting users in such exploratory tasks. ChronoLenses perform on-the-fly transformation of the data points in their focus area, tightly integrating visual analysis with user actions, and enabling the progressive construction of advanced visual analysis pipelines.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2011.195
Ambient Visualization,InfoVis,2011,DICON: Interactive Visual Analysis of Multidimensional Clusters,"Clustering as a fundamental data analysis technique has been widely used in many analytic applications. However, it is often difficult for users to understand and evaluate multidimensional clustering results, especially the quality of clusters and their semantics. For large and complex data, high-level statistical information about the clusters is often needed for users to evaluate cluster quality while a detailed display of multidimensional attributes of the data is necessary to understand the meaning of clusters. In this paper, we introduce DICON, an icon-based cluster visualization that embeds statistical information into a multi-attribute display to facilitate cluster interpretation, evaluation, and comparison. We design a treemap-like icon to represent a multidimensional cluster, and the quality of the cluster can be conveniently evaluated with the embedded statistical information. We further develop a novel layout algorithm which can generate similar icons for similar clusters, making comparisons of clusters easier. User interaction and clutter reduction are integrated into the system to help users more effectively analyze and refine clustering results for large datasets. We demonstrate the power of DICON through a user study and a case study in the healthcare domain. Our evaluation shows the benefits of the technique, especially in support of complex multidimensional cluster analysis.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2011.188
Ambient Visualization,VAST,2011,Supporting effective common ground construction in Asynchronous Collaborative Visual Analytics - IEEE Conference Publication,"Asynchronous Collaborative Visual Analytics (ACVA) leverages group sensemaking by releasing the constraints on when, where, and who works collaboratively. A significant task to be addressed before ACVA can reach its full potential is effective common ground construction, namely the process in which users evaluate insights from individual work to develop a shared understanding of insights and collectively pool them. This is challenging due to the lack of instant communication and scale of collaboration in ACVA. We propose a novel visual analytics approach that automatically gathers, organizes, and summarizes insights to form common ground with reduced human effort. The rich set of visualization and interaction techniques provided in our approach allows users to effectively and flexibly control the common ground construction and review, explore, and compare insights in detail. A working prototype of the approach has been implemented. We have conducted a case study and a user study to demonstrate its effectiveness.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2011.6102447

Despite the growing interest and substantial studies regarding the topic, understanding the major roadblocks of using such tools from novice users' perspectives is still limited. Therefore, we attempted to identify such ""visual analytic roadblocks"" for novice users in an investigative analysis scenario. To achieve this goal, we reviewed the existing models, theories, and frameworks that could explain the cognitive processes of human-visualization interaction in investigative analysis. Then, we conducted a qualitative experiment with six novice participants, using a slightly modified version of pair analytics, and analyzed the results through the open-coding method. As a result, we came up with four visual analytic roadblocks and explained these roadblocks using existing cognitive models and theories. We also provided design suggestions to overcome these roadblocks.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2011.6102435
Ambient Visualization,VAST,2011,A visual navigation system for querying neural stem cell imaging data - IEEE Conference Publication,"Cellular biology deals with studying the behavior of cells. Current time-lapse imaging microscopes help us capture the progress of experiments at intervals that allow for understanding of the dynamic and kinematic behavior of the cells. On the other hand, these devices generate such massive amounts of data (250GB of data per experiment) that manual sieving of data to identify interesting patterns becomes virtually impossible. In this paper we propose an end-to-end system to analyze time-lapse images of the cultures of human neural stem cells (hNSC), that includes an image processing system to analyze the images to extract all the relevant geometric and statistical features within and between images, a database management system to manage and handle queries on the data, a visual analytic system to navigate through the data, and a visual query system to explore different relationships and correlations between the parameters. In each stage of the pipeline we make novel algorithmic and conceptual contributions, and the entire system design is motivated by many different yet unanswered exploratory questions pursued by our neurobiologist collaborators. With a few examples we show how such abstract biological queries can be analyzed and answered by our system.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2011.6102459
Ambient Visualization,Vis,2011,Projection-Based Metal-Artifact Reduction for Industrial 3D X-ray Computed Tomography,"Multi-material components, which contain metal parts surrounded by plastic materials, are highly interesting for inspection using industrial 3D X-ray computed tomography (3DXCT). Examples of this application scenario are connectors or housings with metal inlays in the electronic or automotive industry. A major problem of this type of components is the presence of metal, which causes streaking artifacts and distorts the surrounding media in the reconstructed volume. Streaking artifacts and dark-band artifacts around metal components significantly influence the material characterization (especially for the plastic components). In specific cases these artifacts even prevent a further analysis. Due to the nature and the different characteristics of artifacts, the development of an efficient artifact-reduction technique in reconstruction-space is rather complicated. In this paper we present a projection-space pipeline for metal-artifacts reduction. The proposed technique first segments the metal in the spatial domain of the reconstructed volume in order to separate it from the other materials. Then metal parts are forward-projected on the set of projections in a way that metal-projection regions are treated as voids. Subsequently the voids, which are left by the removed metal, are interpolated in the 2D projections. Finally, the metal is inserted back into the reconstructed 3D volume during the fusion stage. We present a visual analysis tool, allowing for interactive parameter estimation of the metal segmentation. The results of the proposed artifact-reduction technique are demonstrated on a test part as well as on real world components. For these specimens we achieve a significant reduction of metal artifacts, allowing an enhanced material characterization.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2011.228
Ambient Visualization,Vis,2011,Tuner: Principled Parameter Finding for Image Segmentation Algorithms Using Visual Response Surface Exploration,"In this paper we address the difficult problem of parameter-finding in image segmentation. We replace a tedious manual process that is often based on guess-work and luck by a principled approach that systematically explores the parameter space. Our core idea is the following two-stage technique: We start with a sparse sampling of the parameter space and apply a statistical model to estimate the response of the segmentation algorithm. The statistical model incorporates a model of uncertainty of the estimation which we use in conjunction with the actual estimate in (visually) guiding the user towards areas that need refinement by placing additional sample points. In the second stage the user navigates through the parameter space in order to determine areas where the response value (goodness of segmentation) is high. In our exploration we rely on existing ground-truth images in order to evaluate the \""goodness\"" of an image segmentation technique. We evaluate its usefulness by demonstrating this technique on two image segmentation algorithms: a three parameter model to detect microtubules in electron tomograms and an eight parameter model to identify functional regions in dynamic Positron Emission Tomography scans.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2011.248
Ambient Visualization,Vis,2011,Feature-Based Statistical Analysis of Combustion Simulation Data,"We present a new framework for feature-based statistical analysis of large-scale scientific data and demonstrate its effectiveness by analyzing features from Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of turbulent combustion. Turbulent flows are ubiquitous and account for transport and mixing processes in combustion, astrophysics, fusion, and climate modeling among other disciplines. They are also characterized by coherent structure or organized motion, i.e. nonlocal entities whose geometrical features can directly impact molecular mixing and reactive processes. While traditional multi-point statistics provide correlative information, they lack nonlocal structural information, and hence, fail to provide mechanistic causality information between organized fluid motion and mixing and reactive processes. Hence, it is of great interest to capture and track flow features and their statistics together with their correlation with relevant scalar quantities, e.g. temperature or species concentrations. In our approach we encode the set of all possible flow features by pre-computing merge trees augmented with attributes, such as statistical moments of various scalar fields, e.g. temperature, as well as length-scales computed via spectral analysis. The computation is performed in an efficient streaming manner in a pre-processing step and results in a collection of meta-data that is orders of magnitude smaller than the original simulation data. This meta-data is sufficient to support a fully flexible and interactive analysis of the features, allowing for arbitrary thresholds, providing per-feature statistics, and creating various global diagnostics such as Cumulative Density Functions (CDFs), histograms, or time-series. We combine the analysis with a rendering of the features in a linked-view browser that enables scientists to interactively explore, visualize, and analyze the equivalent of one terabyte of simulation data. We highlight the utility of this new framework for combustion science; however, it is applicable to many other science domains.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2011.199
Ambient Visualization,VAST,2010,Click2Annotate: Automated Insight Externalization with rich semantics - IEEE Conference Publication,"Insight Externalization (IE) refers to the process of capturing and recording the semantics of insights in decision making and problem solving. To reduce human effort, Automated Insight Externalization (AIE) is desired. Most existing IE approaches achieve automation by capturing events (e.g., clicks and key presses) or actions (e.g., panning and zooming). In this paper, we propose a novel AIE approach named Click2Annotate. It allows semi-automatic insight annotation that captures low-level analytics task results (e.g., clusters and outliers), which have higher semantic richness and abstraction levels than actions and events. Click2Annotate has two significant benefits. First, it reduces human effort required in IE and generates annotations easy to understand. Second, the rich semantic information encoded in the annotations enables various insight management activities, such as insight browsing and insight retrieval. We present a formal user study that proved this first benefit. We also illustrate the second benefit by presenting the novel insight management activities we developed based on Click2Annotate, namely scented insight browsing and faceted insight search.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2010.5652885
Ambient Visualization,VAST,2010,"Geo-historical context support for information foraging and sensemaking: Conceptual model, implementation, and assessment - IEEE Conference Publication","Information foraging and sensemaking with heterogeneous information are context-dependent activities. Thus visual analytics tools to support these activities must incorporate context. But, context is a difficult concept to define, model, and represent. Creating and representing context in support of visually-enabled reasoning about complex problems with complex information is a complementary but different challenge than that addressed in context-aware computing. In the latter, the goal is automated adaptation of the system to meet user needs for applications such as mobile location-based services where information about the location, the user, and the user goals filters what gets presented on a small mobile device. In contrast, for visual analytics-enabled information foraging and sensemaking, the user is likely to take an active role in foraging for the contextual information needed to support sensemaking in relation to some multifaceted problem. In this paper, we address the challenges of constructing and representing context within visual interfaces that support analytical reasoning in crisis management and humanitarian relief. The challenges stem from the diverse forms of information that can provide context and difficulty in defining and operationalizing context itself. Here, we pay particular attention to document foraging to support construction of the geographic and historical context within which monitoring and sensemaking can be carried out. Specifically, we present the concept of geo-historical context (GHC) and outline an empirical assessment of both the concept and its implementation in the Context Discovery Application, a web- based tool that supports document foraging and sensemaking.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2010.5652895
Ambient Visualization,VAST,2010,Visual market sector analysis for financial time series data - IEEE Conference Publication,"The massive amount of financial time series data that originates from the stock market generates large amounts of complex data of high interest. However, adequate solutions that can effectively handle the information in order to gain insight and to understand the market mechanisms are rare. In this paper, we present two techniques and applications that enable the user to interactively analyze large amounts of time series data in real-time in order to get insight into the development of assets, market sectors, countries, and the financial market as a whole. The first technique allows users to quickly analyze combinations of single assets, market sectors as well as countries, compare them to each other, and to visually discover the periods of time where market sectors and countries get into turbulence. The second application clusters a selection of large amounts of financial time series data according to their similarity, and analyzes the distribution of the assets among market sectors. This allows users to identify the characteristic graphs which are representative for the development of a particular market sector, and also to identify the assets which behave considerably differently compared to other assets in the same sector. Both applications allow the user to perform investigative exploration techniques and interactive visual analysis in real- time.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2010.5652530
Ambient Visualization,VAST,2010,Finding and visualizing relevant subspaces for clustering high-dimensional astronomical data using connected morphological operators - IEEE Conference Publication,"Data sets in astronomy are growing to enormous sizes. Modern astronomical surveys provide not only image data but also catalogues of millions of objects (stars, galaxies), each object with hundreds of associated parameters. Exploration of this very high-dimensional data space poses a huge challenge. Subspace clustering is one among several approaches which have been proposed for this purpose in recent years. However, many clustering algorithms require the user to set a large number of parameters without any guidelines. Some methods also do not provide a concise summary of the datasets, or, if they do, they lack additional important information such as the number of clusters present or the significance of the clusters. In this paper, we propose a method for ranking subspaces for clustering which overcomes many of the above limitations. First we carry out a transformation from parametric space to discrete image space where the data are represented by a grid-based density field. Then we apply so-called connected morphological operators on this density field of astronomical objects that provides visual support for the analysis of the important subspaces. Clusters in subspaces correspond to high-intensity regions in the density image. The importance of a cluster is measured by a new quality criterion based on the dynamics of local maxima of the density. Connected operators are able to extract such regions with an indication of the number of clusters present. The subspaces are visualized during computation of the quality measure, so that the user can interact with the system to improve the results. In the result stage, we use three visualization toolkits linked within a graphical user interface so that the user can perform an in-depth exploration of the ranked subspaces. Evaluation based on synthetic as well as real astronomical datasets demonstrates the power of the new method. We recover various known astronomical relations directly from the data with little or no a priori assumptions. Hence, our method holds good prospects for discovering new relations as well.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2010.5652450

Ambient Visualization,VAST,2010,Visual exploration of classification models for risk assessment - IEEE Conference Publication,"In risk assessment applications well informed decisions are made based on huge amounts of multi- dimensional data. In many domains not only the risk of a wrong decision, but in particular the trade-off between the costs of possible decisions are of utmost importance. In this paper we describe a framework tightly integrating interactive visual exploration with machine learning to support the decision making process. The proposed approach uses a series of interactive 2D visualizations of numeric and ordinal data combined with visualization of classification models. These series of visual elements are further linked to the classifier's performance visualized using an interactive performance curve. An interactive decision point on the performance curve allows the decision maker to steer the classification model and instantly identify the critical, cost changing data elements, in the various linked visualizations. The critical data elements are represented as images in order to trigger associations related to the knowledge of the expert. In this context the data visualization and classification results are not only linked together, but are also linked back to the classification model. Such a visual analytics framework allows the user to interactively explore the costs of his decisions for different settings of the model and accordingly use the most suitable classification model and make more informed and reliable decisions. A case study on data from the Forensic Psychiatry domain reveals the usefulness of the suggested approach.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2010.5652398

Ambient Visualization,VAST,2010,Comparing different levels of interaction constraints for deriving visual problem isomorphs - IEEE Conference Publication,"Interaction and manual manipulation have been shown in the cognitive science literature to play a critical role in problem solving. Given different types of interactions or constraints on interactions, a problem can appear to have different degrees of difficulty. While this relationship between interaction and problem solving has been well studied in the cognitive science literatures, the visual analytics community has yet to exploit this understanding for analytical problem solving. In this paper, we hypothesize that constraints on interactions and constraints encoded in visual representations can lead to strategies of varying effectiveness during problem solving. To test our hypothesis, we conducted a user study in which participants were given different levels of interaction constraints when solving a simple math game called Number Scrabble. Number Scrabble is known to have an optimal visual problem isomorph, and the goal of this study is to learn if and how the participants could derive the isomorph and to analyze the strategies that the participants utilize in solving the problem. Our results indicate that constraints on interactions do affect problem solving, and that while the optimal visual isomorph is difficult to derive, certain interaction constraints can lead to a higher chance of deriving the isomorph.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2010.5653599

The task of finding the correct parameters for a desired result, however, is difficult and time-consuming as current tools provide little to no guidance. In this paper, we present a new approach for the visual exploration of such parameter spaces. Given a three-dimensional scene description, we utilize sampling and spatio-temporal clustering techniques to generate a concise overview of the achievable variations and their temporal evolution. Our visualization system then allows the user to explore the simulation space in a goal-oriented manner. Animation sequences with a set of desired characteristics can be composed using a novel search-by- example approach and interactive direct volume rendering is employed to provide instant visual feedback.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2010.190

SellTrend combines a diverse set of techniques ranging from time series visualization to faceted browsing and historical trend analysis in order to help analysts make sense of the data.

Ambient Visualization,InfoVis,2009,FromDaDy: Spreading Aircraft Trajectories Across Views to Support Iterative Queries,"When displaying thousands of aircraft trajectories on a screen, the visualization is spoiled by a tangle of trails. The visual analysis is therefore difficult, especially if a specific class of trajectories in an erroneous dataset has to be studied. We designed FromDaDy, a trajectory visualization tool that tackles the difficulties of exploring the visualization of multiple trails. This multidimensional data exploration is based on scatterplots, brushing, pick and drop, juxtaposed views and rapid visual design. Users can organize the workspace composed of multiple juxtaposed views. They can define the visual configuration of the views by connecting data dimensions from the dataset to Bertin's visual variables. They can then brush trajectories, and with a pick and drop operation they can spread the brushed information across views. They can then repeat these interactions, until they extract a set of relevant data, thus formulating complex queries. Through two real-world scenarios, we show how FromDaDy supports iterative queries and the extraction of trajectories in a dataset that contains up to 5 million data.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2009.145
Ambient Visualization,InfoVis,2009,Configuring Hierarchical Layouts to Address Research Questions,"We explore the effects of selecting alternative layouts in hierarchical displays that show multiple aspects of large multivariate datasets, including spatial and temporal characteristics. Hierarchical displays of this type condition a dataset by multiple discrete variable values, creating nested graphical summaries of the resulting subsets in which size, shape and colour can be used to show subset properties. These 'small multiples' are ordered by the conditioning variable values and are laid out hierarchically using dimensional stacking. Crucially, we consider the use of different layouts at different hierarchical levels, so that the coordinates of the plane can be used more effectively to draw attention to trends and anomalies in the data. We argue that these layouts should be informed by the type of conditioning variable and by the research question being explored. We focus on space-filling rectangular layouts that provide data-dense and rich overviews of data to address research questions posed in our exploratory analysis of spatial and temporal aspects of property sales in London. We develop a notation ('HiVE') that describes visualisation and layout states and provides reconfiguration operators, demonstrate its use for reconfiguring layouts to pursue research questions and provide guidelines for this process. We demonstrate how layouts can be related through animated transitions to reduce the cognitive load associated with their reconfiguration whilst supporting the exploratory process.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2009.128
Ambient Visualization,InfoVis,2009,ActiviTree: Interactive Visual Exploration of Sequences in Event-Based Data Using Graph Similarity,"The identification of significant sequences in large and complex event-based temporal data is a challenging problem with applications in many areas of today's information intensive society. Pure visual representations can be used for the analysis, but are constrained to small data sets. Algorithmic search mechanisms used for larger data sets become expensive as the data size increases and typically focus on frequency of occurrence to reduce the computational complexity, often overlooking important infrequent sequences and outliers. In this paper we introduce an interactive visual data mining approach based on an adaptation of techniques developed for Web searching, combined with an intuitive visual interface, to facilitate user-centred exploration of the data and identification of sequences significant to that user. The search algorithm used in the exploration executes in negligible time, even for large data, and so no pre- processing of the selected data is required, making this a completely interactive experience for the user. Our particular application area is social science diary data but the technique is applicable across many other disciplines.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2009.117
Ambient Visualization,InfoVis,2009,Conjunctive Visual Forms,"Visual exploration of multidimensional data is a process of isolating and extracting relationships within and between dimensions. Coordinated multiple view approaches are particularly effective for visual exploration because they support precise expression of heterogeneous multidimensional queries using simple interactions. Recent visual analytics research has made significant progress in identifying and understanding patterns of composed views and coordinations that support fast, flexible, and open-ended data exploration. What is missing is formalization of the space of expressible queries in terms of visual representation and interaction. This paper introduces the conjunctive visual form model in which visual exploration consists of interactively-driven sequences of transitions between visual states that correspond to conjunctive normal forms in boolean logic. The model predicts several new and useful ways to extend the space of rapidly expressible queries through addition of simple interactive capabilities to existing compositional patterns. Two recent related visual tools offer a subset of these capabilities, providing a basis for conjecturing about such extensions.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2009.129
Ambient Visualization,VAST,2009,Using projection and 2D plots to visually reveal genetic mechanisms of complex human disorders - IEEE Conference Publication,"Gene mapping is a statistical method used to localize human disease genes to particular regions of the human genome. When performing such analysis, a genetic likelihood space is generated and sampled, which results in a multidimensional scalar field. Researchers are interested in exploring this likelihood space through the use of visualization. Previous efforts at visualizing this space, though, were slow and cumbersome, only showing a small portion of the space at a time, thus requiring the user to keep a mental picture of several views. We have developed a new technique that displays much more data at once by projecting the multidimensional data into several 2D plots. One plot is created for each parameter that shows the change along that parameter. A radial projection is used to create another plot that provides an overview of the high dimensional surface from the perspective of a single point. Linking and brushing between all the plots are used to determine relationships between parameters. We demonstrate our techniques on real world autism data, showing how to visually examine features of the high dimensional space.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2009.5333917
Ambient Visualization,VAST,2009,MassVis: Visual analysis of protein complexes using mass spectrometry - IEEE Conference Publication,"Protein complexes are formed when two or more proteins non-covalently interact to form a larger three dimensional structure with specific biological function. Understanding the composition of such complexes is vital to understanding cell biology at the molecular level. MassVis is a visual analysis tool designed to assist the interpretation of data from a new workflow for detecting the composition of such protein complexes in biological samples. The data generated by the laboratory workflow naturally lends itself to a scatter plot visualization. However, characteristics of this data give rise to some unique aspects not typical of a standard scatter plot. We are able to take the output from tandem mass spectrometry and render the data in such a way that it mimics more traditional two-dimensional gel techniques and at the same time reveals the correlated behavior indicative of protein complexes. By computationally measuring these correlated patterns in the data, membership in putative complexes can be inferred. User interactions are provided to support both an interactive discovery mode as well as an unsupervised clustering of likely complexes. The specific analysis tasks led us to design a unique arrangement of item selection and coordinated detail views in order to simultaneously view different aspects of the selected item.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2009.5333895
Ambient Visualization,VAST,2009,Model space visualization for multivariate linear trend discovery - IEEE Conference Publication,"Discovering and extracting linear trends and correlations in datasets is very important for analysts to understand multivariate phenomena. However, current widely used multivariate visualization techniques, such as parallel coordinates and scatterplot matrices, fail to reveal and illustrate such linear relationships intuitively, especially when more than 3 variables are involved or multiple trends coexist in the dataset. We present a novel multivariate model parameter space visualization system that helps analysts discover single and multiple linear patterns and extract subsets of data that fit a model well. Using this system, analysts are able to explore and navigate in model parameter space, interactively select and tune patterns, and refine the model for accuracy using computational techniques. We build connections between model space and data space visually, allowing analysts to employ their domain knowledge during exploration to better interpret the patterns they discover and their validity.

Ambient Visualization,Vis,2009,Visual Exploration of Nasal Airflow,"Rhinologists are often faced with the challenge of assessing nasal breathing from a functional point of view to derive effective therapeutic interventions. While the complex nasal anatomy can be revealed by visual inspection and medical imaging, only vague information is available regarding the nasal airflow itself: Rhinomanometry delivers rather unspecific integral information on the pressure gradient as well as on total flow and nasal flow resistance. In this article we demonstrate how the understanding of physiological nasal breathing can be improved by simulating and visually analyzing nasal airflow, based on an anatomically correct model of the upper human respiratory tract. In particular we demonstrate how various information visualization (InfoVis) techniques, such as a highly scalable implementation of parallel coordinates, time series visualizations, as well as unstructured grid multi-volume rendering, all integrated within a multiple linked views framework, can be utilized to gain a deeper understanding of nasal breathing. Evaluation is accomplished by visual exploration of spatio-temporal airflow characteristics that include not only information on flow features but also on accompanying quantities such as temperature and humidity. To our knowledge, this is the first in-depth visual exploration of the physiological function of the nose over several simulated breathing cycles under consideration of a complete model of the nasal airways, realistic boundary conditions, and all physically relevant time-varying quantities.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2009.198
Ambient Visualization,InfoVis,2008,Rolling the Dice: Multidimensional Visual Exploration using Scatterplot Matrix Navigation,"Scatterplots remain one of the most popular and widely-used visual representations for multidimensional data due to their simplicity, familiarity and visual clarity, even if they lack some of the flexibility and visual expressiveness of newer multidimensional visualization techniques. This paper presents new interactive methods to explore multidimensional data using scatterplots. This exploration is performed using a matrix of scatterplots that gives an overview of the possible configurations, thumbnails of the scatterplots, and support for interactive navigation in the multidimensional space. Transitions between scatterplots are performed as animated rotations in 3D space, somewhat akin to rolling dice. Users can iteratively build queries using bounding volumes in the dataset, sculpting the query from different viewpoints to become more and more refined. Furthermore, the dimensions in the navigation space can be reordered, manually or automatically, to highlight salient correlations and differences among them. An example scenario presents the interaction techniques supporting smooth and effortless visual exploration of multidimensional datasets.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2008.153

Drawing from visual information seeking and exploratory search, we introduce VisGets - interactive query visualizations of Web-based information that operate with online information within a Web browser. VisGets provide the information seeker with visual overviews of Web resources and offer a way to visually filter the data. Our goal is to facilitate the construction of dynamic search queries that combine filters from more than one data dimension.

A Visual Query Language for Opinion Data,"Surveys and opinion polls are extremely popular in the media, especially in the months preceding a general election. However, the available tools for analyzing poll results often require specialized training. Hence, data analysis remains out of reach for many casual computer users. Moreover, the visualizations used to communicate the results of surveys are typically limited to traditional statistical graphics like bar graphs and pie charts, both of which are fundamentally noninteractive. We present a simple interactive visualization that allows users to construct queries on large tabular data sets, and view the results in real time.

We have modified the Entity Workspace system, described previously, to test such designs. We have evaluated the resulting design in both a laboratory study and a study where it is situated with an analysis team. In both cases, effects on collaboration appear to be positive. Key aspects of the design include an evidence notebook optimized for organizing entities (rather than text characters), information structures that can be collapsed and expanded, visualization of evidence that emphasizes events and documents (rather than emphasizing the entity graph), and a notification system that finds entities of mutual interest to multiple analysts.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2008.4677362

Ambient Visualization,VAST,2008,Characterizing users' visual analytic activity for insight provenance - IEEE Conference Publication,"Insight provenance--a historical record of the process and rationale by which an insight is derived--is an essential requirement in many visual analytics applications. While work in this area has relied on either manually recorded provenance (e.g., user notes) or automatically recorded event-based insight provenance (e.g., clicks, drags, and key-presses), both approaches have fundamental limitations. Our aim is to develop a new approach that combines the benefits of both approaches while avoiding their deficiencies. Toward this goal, we characterize users' visual analytic activity at multiple levels of granularity. Moreover, we identify a critical level of abstraction, Actions, that can be used to represent visual analytic activity with a set of general but semantically meaningful behavior types. In turn, the action types can be used as the semantic building blocks for insight provenance. We present a catalog of common actions identified through observations of several different visual analytic systems. In addition, we define a taxonomy to categorize actions into three major classes based on their semantic intent. The concept of actions has been integrated into our lab's prototype visual analytic system, HARVEST, as the basis for its insight provenance capabilities.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2008.4677365

Focusing on real-time video data visualization, we evaluated two important design factors - video placement method and spatial context presentation method - through a user study. In addition, we evaluated the effect of spatial knowledge of the environment. Participantspsila performance was measured through path reconstruction tasks, where the participants followed a target through simulated surveillance videos and marked the target paths on the environment model. We found that embedding videos inside the model enabled realtime strategies and led to faster performance. With the help of contextualized videos, participants not familiar with the real environment achieved similar task performance to participants that worked in that environment.

In particular, we compute correspondences between existing pipeline subgraphs from the database, and use these to predict sets of likely pipeline additions to a given partial pipeline. By presenting these predictions in a carefully designed interface, users can create visualizations and other data products more efficiently because they can augment their normal work patterns with the suggested completions.

Ambient Visualization,Vis,2008,Relation-Aware Volume Exploration Pipeline,"Volume exploration is an important issue in scientific visualization. Research on volume exploration has been focused on revealing hidden structures in volumetric data. While the information of individual structures or features is useful in practice, spatial relations between structures are also important in many applications and can provide further insights into the data. In this paper, we systematically study the extraction, representation,exploration, and visualization of spatial relations in volumetric data and propose a novel relation-aware visualization pipeline for volume exploration. In our pipeline, various relations in the volume are first defined and measured using region connection calculus (RCC) and then represented using a graph interface called relation graph. With RCC and the relation graph, relation query and interactive exploration can be conducted in a comprehensive and intuitive way. The visualization process is further assisted with relation-revealing viewpoint selection and color and opacity enhancement. We also introduce a quality assessment scheme which evaluates the perception of spatial relations in the rendered images.

Ambient Visualization,Vis,2008,Hypothesis Generation in Climate Research with Interactive Visual Data Exploration,"One of the most prominent topics in climate research is the investigation, detection, and allocation of climate change. In this paper, we aim at identifying regions in the atmosphere (e.g., certain height layers) which can act as sensitive and robust indicators for climate change. We demonstrate how interactive visual data exploration of large amounts of multi-variate and time-dependent climate data enables the steered generation of promising hypotheses for subsequent statistical evaluation. The use of new visualization and interaction technology-in the context of a coordinated multiple views framework-allows not only to identify these promising hypotheses, but also to efficiently narrow down parameters that are required in the process of computational data analysis. Two datasets, namely an ECHAM5 climate model run and the ERA-40 reanalysis incorporating observational data, are investigated. Higher-order information such as linear trends or signal-to-noise ratio is derived and interactively explored in order to detect and explore those regions which react most sensitively to climate change.

Searching for oil and gas involves creating a structural overview of seismic reflection data to identify hydrocarbon reservoirs. We improve the search of seismic structures by precalculating the horizon structures of the seismic data prior to interpretation. We improve the annotation of seismic structures by applying novel illustrative rendering algorithms tailored to seismic data, such as deformed texturing and line and texture transfer functions. The illustrative rendering results in multi-attribute and scale invariant visualizations where features are represented clearly in both highly zoomed in and zoomed out views. Thumbnail views in combination with interactive appearance control allows for a quick overview of the data before detailed interpretation takes place. These techniques help reduce the work of seismic illustrators and interpreters.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2008.170
Ambient Visualization,InfoVis,2007,Geographically Weighted Visualization: Interactive Graphics for Scale-Varying Exploratory Analysis,"We introduce a series of geographically weighted (GW) interactive graphics, or geowigs, and use them to explore spatial relationships at a range of scales. We visually encode information about geographic and statistical proximity and variation in novel ways through _gw-choropleth maps_ , multivariate _gw-boxplots, gw-shading_ and _scalograms_. The new graphic types reveal information about GW statistics at several scales concurrently. We impement these views in prototype software containing dynamic links and GW interactions that encourage exploration and refine them to consider directional geographies. An informal evaluation uses interactive GW techniques to consider Guerry's dataset of 'moral statistics', casting doubt on correlations originally proposed through visual analysis, revealing new local anomalies and suggesting multivariate geographic relationships. Few attempts at visually synthesising geography with multivariate statistical values at multiple scales have been reported. The _geowigs_ proposed here provide informative representations of multivariate local variation, particularly when combined with interactions that coordinate views and result in _gw-shading_. We argue that they are widely applicable to area and point-based geographic data and provide a set of methods to support visual analysis using GW statistics through which the effects of geography can be explored at multiple scales.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2007.70558
Ambient Visualization,InfoVis,2007,Show Me: Automatic Presentation for Visual Analysis,"This paper describes Show Me, an integrated set of user interface commands and defaults that incorporate automatic presentation into a commercial visual analysis system called Tableau. A key aspect of Tableau is VizQL, a language for specifying views, which is used by Show Me to extend automatic presentation to the generation of tables of views (commonly called small multiple displays). A key research issue for the commercial application of automatic presentation is the user experience, which must support the flow of visual analysis. User experience has not been the focus of previous research on automatic presentation. The Show Me user experience includes the automatic selection of mark types, a command to add a single field to a view, and a pair of commands to build views for multiple fields. Although the use of these defaults and commands is optional, user interface logs indicate that Show Me is used by commercial users.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2007.70594

We provide a number of example applications and describe a controlled experiment which finds that users exploring unfamiliar data make up to twice as many unique discoveries using widgets imbued with social navigation data. However, these differences equalize as familiarity with the data increases.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2007.70589

While both methods have merits, statistical methods can miss previously unknown sub- populations in the data and detailed analyses may have selection biases. We therefore built Session Viewer, a visualization tool to facilitate and bridge between statistical and detailed analyses. Taking a multiple-coordinated view approach, Session Viewer shows multiple session populations at the Aggregate, Multiple, and Detail data levels to support different analysis styles. To bridge between the statistical and the detailed analysis levels, Session Viewer provides fluid traversal between data levels and side-by-side comparison at all data levels.

Ambient Visualization,VAST,2007,SpiralView: Towards Security Policies Assessment through Visual Correlation of Network Resources with Evolution of Alarms - IEEE Conference Publication,"This article presents SpiralView, a visualization tool for helping system administrators to assess network policies. The tool is meant to be a complementary support to the routine activity of network monitoring, enabling a retrospective view on the alarms generated during and extended period of time. The tool permits to reason about how alarms distribute over time and how they correlate with network resources (e.g., users, IPs, applications, etc.), supporting the analysts in understanding how the network evolves and thus in devising new security policies for the future. The spiral visualization plots alarms in time, and, coupled with interactive bar charts and a users/applications graph view, is used to present network data and perform queries. The user is able to segment the data in meaningful subsets, zoom on specific related information, and inspect for relationships between alarms, users, and applications. In designing the visualizations and their interaction, and through tests with security experts, several ameliorations over the standard techniques have been provided.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2007.4389007

As the number of documents and the corresponding number of concepts and entities within the documents grow larger, sense-making processes become more and more difficult for the analysts. We have developed a visual analytic system called Jigsaw that represents documents and their entities visually in order to help analysts examine reports more efficiently and develop theories about potential actions more quickly. Jigsaw provides multiple coordinated views of document entities with a special emphasis on visually illustrating connections between entities across the different documents.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2007.4389006
Ambient Visualization,VAST,2007,Analysis Guided Visual Exploration of Multivariate Data - IEEE Conference Publication,"Visualization systems traditionally focus on graphical representation of information. They tend not to provide integrated analytical services that could aid users in tackling complex knowledge discovery tasks. Users' exploration in such environments is usually impeded due to several problems: 1) valuable information is hard to discover when too much data is visualized on the screen; 2) Users have to manage and organize their discoveries off line, because no systematic discovery management mechanism exists; 3) their discoveries based on visual exploration alone may lack accuracy; 4) and they have no convenient access to the important knowledge learned by other users. To tackle these problems, it has been recognized that analytical tools must be introduced into visualization systems. In this paper, we present a novel analysis-guided exploration system, called the nugget management system (NMS). It leverages the collaborative effort of human comprehensibility and machine computations to facilitate users' visual exploration processes. Specifically, NMS first extracts the valuable information (nuggets) hidden in datasets based on the interests of users. Given that similar nuggets may be re-discovered by different users, NMS consolidates the nugget candidate set by clustering based on their semantic similarity. To solve the problem of inaccurate discoveries, localized data mining techniques are applied to refine the nuggets to best represent the captured patterns in datasets. Lastly, the resulting well- organized nugget pool is used to guide users' exploration. To evaluate the effectiveness of NMS, we integrated NMS into Xmd- vTool, a freeware multivariate visualization system. User studies were performed to compare the users' efficiency and accuracy in finishing tasks on real datasets, with and without the help of NMS. Our user studies confirmed the effectiveness of NMS.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2007.4389000
Ambient Visualization,VAST,2007,DataMeadow: A Visual Canvas for Analysis of Large-Scale Multivariate Data - IEEE Conference Publication,"Supporting visual analytics of multiple large- scale multidimensional datasets requires a high degree of interactivity and user control beyond the conventional challenges of visualizing such datasets. We present the DataMeadow, a visual canvas providing rich interaction for constructing visual queries using graphical set representations called DataRoses. A DataRose is essentially a starplot of selected columns in a dataset displayed as multivariate visualizations with dynamic query sliders integrated into each axis. The purpose of the DataMeadow is to allow users to create advanced visual queries by iteratively selecting and filtering into the multidimensional data. Furthermore, the canvas provides a clear history of the analysis that can be annotated to facilitate dissemination of analytical results to outsiders. Towards this end, the DataMeadow has a direct manipulation interface for selection, filtering, and creation of sets, subsets, and data dependencies using both simple and complex mouse gestures. We have evaluated our system using a qualitative expert review involving two researchers working in the area. Results from this review are favorable for our new method.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2007.4389013
Ambient Visualization,VAST,2007,Design Considerations for Collaborative Visual Analytics - IEEE Conference Publication,"Information visualization leverages the human visual system to support the process of sensemaking, in which information is collected, organized, and analyzed to generate knowledge and inform action. Though most research to date assumes a single-user focus on perceptual and cognitive processes, in practice, sensemaking is often a social process involving parallelization of effort, discussion, and consensus building. This suggests that to fully support sensemaking, interactive visualization should also support social interaction. However, the most appropriate collaboration mechanisms for supporting this interaction are not immediately clear. In this article, we present design considerations for asynchronous collaboration in visual analysis environments, highlighting issues of work parallelization, communication, and social organization. These considerations provide a guide for the design and evaluation of collaborative visualization systems.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2007.4389011

We use data from our large-scale newspaper analysis system (Lydia) to make entity datamaps, a spatial visualization of the interest in a given named entity. Our goal is to identify entities which display regional biases. We develop a model of estimating the frequency of reference of an entity in any given city from the reference frequency centered in surrounding cities, and techniques for evaluating the spatial significance of this distribution",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2006.179
Ambient Visualization,InfoVis,2006,Balancing Systematic and Flexible Exploration of Social Networks,"Social network analysis (SNA) has emerged as a powerful method for understanding the importance of relationships in networks. However, interactive exploration of networks is currently challenging because: (1) it is difficult to find patterns and comprehend the structure of networks with many nodes and links, and (2) current systems are often a medley of statistical methods and overwhelming visual output which leaves many analysts uncertain about how to explore in an orderly manner. This results in exploration that is largely opportunistic. Our contributions are techniques to help structural analysts understand social networks more effectively. We present SocialAction, a system that uses attribute ranking and coordinated views to help users systematically examine numerous SNA measures. Users can (1) flexibly iterate through visualizations of measures to gain an overview, filter nodes, and find outliers, (2) aggregate networks using link structure, find cohesive subgroups, and focus on communities of interest, and (3) untangle networks by viewing different link types separately, or find patterns across different link types using a matrix overview. For each operation, a stable node layout is maintained in the network visualization so users can make comparisons. SocialAction offers analysts a strategy beyond opportunism, as it provides systematic, yet flexible, techniques for exploring social networks",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2006.122
Ambient Visualization,InfoVis,2006,MatrixExplorer: a Dual-Representation System to Explore Social Networks,"MatrixExplorer is a network visualization system that uses two representations: node-link diagrams and matrices. Its design comes from a list of requirements formalized after several interviews and a participatory design session conducted with social science researchers. Although matrices are commonly used in social networks analysis, very few systems support the matrix-based representations to visualize and analyze networks. MatrixExplorer provides several novel features to support the exploration of social networks with a matrix-based representation, in addition to the standard interactive filtering and clustering functions. It provides tools to reorder (layout) matrices, to annotate and compare findings across different layouts and find consensus among several clusterings. MatrixExplorer also supports node-link diagram views which are familiar to most users and remain a convenient way to publish or communicate exploration results. Matrix and node-link representations are kept synchronized at all stages of the exploration process",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2006.160

This paper offers an abstract content-actor network data model, a classification of tasks, and a tool to support them. The NetLens interface was designed around the abstract content-actor network data model to allow users to pose a series of elementary queries and iteratively refine visual overviews and sorted lists. This enables the support of complex queries that are traditionally hard to specify. NetLens is general and scalable in that it applies to any dataset that can be represented with our abstract data model.

Visual identification and comparison of patterns of recurring events is an essential feature of such tools. In this paper, we describe a tool for exploring hotel visitation patterns in and around Rebersburg, Pennsylvania from 1898-1900. The tool uses a wrapping spreadsheet technique, called reruns, to display cyclic patterns of geographic events in multiple overlapping natural and artificial calendars. Implemented as an improvise visualization, the tool is in active development through a iterative process of data collection, hypothesis, design, discovery, and evaluation in close collaboration with historical geographers.

Only by understanding the events that produced the climatic conditions in the past will it be possible to forecast abrupt climate changes and prevent disastrous consequences for human beings and their environment. Paleoceanography research is a collaborative effort that requires the analysis of paleo time-series, which are obtained from a number of independent techniques and instruments and produced by a variety of different researchers and/or laboratories. The complexity of these phenomena that consist of massive, dynamic and often conflicting data can only be faced by means of analytical reasoning supported by a highly interactive visual interface.

Ambient Visualization,VAST,2006,Pixnostics: Towards Measuring the Value of Visualization - IEEE Conference Publication,"During the last two decades a wide variety of advanced methods for the visual exploration of large data sets have been proposed. For most of these techniques user interaction has become a crucial element, since there are many situations in which a user or an analyst has to select the right parameter settings from among many or select a subset of the available attribute space for the visualization process, in order to construct valuable visualizations that provide insight, into the data and reveal interesting patterns. The right choice of input parameters is often essential, since suboptimal parameter settings or the investigation of irrelevant data dimensions make the exploration process more time consuming and may result in wrong conclusions. In this paper we propose a novel method for automatically determining meaningful parameter- and attribute settings based on the information content of the resulting visualizations. Our technique called Pixnostics, in analogy to Scagnostics (Wilkinson et al., 2005), automatically analyses pixel images resulting from diverse parameter mappings and ranks them according to the potential value for the user. This allows a more effective and more efficient visual data analysis process, since the attribute/parameter space is reduced to meaningful selections and thus the analyst obtains faster insight into the data. Real world applications are provided to show the benefit of the proposed approach",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2006.261423

However, extracting such useful relationships without user guidance is cumbersome and often an error prone process. In this paper, we present a visual analysis system that interactively discovers such relationships from the trajectories of derived features. We describe analysis algorithms to derive various spatial and spatio-temporal relationships. A visual interface is presented using which the user can interactively select spatial and temporal extents to guide the knowledge discovery process. We show the usefulness of our proposed algorithms on datasets originating from computational fluid dynamics. We also demonstrate how the derived relationships can help in explaining the occurrence of critical events like merging and bifurcation of the vortices",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2006.261451
Ambient Visualization,VAST,2006,User Interfaces for the Exploration of Hierarchical Multi-dimensional Data - IEEE Conference Publication,"A variety of user interfaces have been developed to support the querying of hierarchical multi-dimensional data in an OLAP setting such as pivot tables and Polaris. They are used to regularly check portions of a dataset and to explore a new dataset for the first time. In this paper, we establish criteria for OLAP user interface capabilities to facilitate comparison. Two criteria are the number of displayed dimensions along which comparisons can be made and the number of dimensions that are viewable at once - visual comparison depth and width. We argue that interfaces with greater visual comparison depth support regular checking of known data by users that know roughly where to look, while interfaces with greater comparison width support exploration of new data by users that have no a priori starting point and need to scan all dimensions. Pivot tables and Polaris are examples of the former. The main contribution of this paper is to introduce a new scalable interface that uses parallel dimension axis which supports the latter, greater visual comparison width. We compare our approach to both table based and parallel coordinate based interfaces. We present an implementation of our interface SGViewer, user scenarios and provide an evaluation that supports the usability of our interface",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2006.261422

To tailor to diverse user queries introduced during a conversation, we automate the generation of system responses, including both spoken and visual outputs. In this paper, we focus on the problem of visual context management, a process that dynamically updates an existing visual display to effectively incorporate new information requested by subsequent user queries. Specifically, we develop an optimization based approach to visual context management. Compared to existing approaches, which normally handle predictable visual context updates, our work offers two unique contributions. First, we provide a general computational framework that can effectively manage a visual context for diverse, unanticipated situations encountered in a user system conversation. Moreover, we optimize the satisfaction of both semantic and visual constraints, which otherwise are difficult to balance using simple heuristics. Second, we present an extensible representation model that uses feature based metrics to uniformly define all constraints.

To help develop these tasks, we collected nearly 200 sample questions from students about how they would analyze five particular data sets from different domains. The questions, while not being totally comprehensive, illustrated the sheer variety of analytic questions typically posed by users when employing information visualization systems. We hope that the presented set of tasks is useful for information visualization system designers as a kind of common substrate to discuss the relative analytic capabilities of the systems.

Ambient Visualization,Vis,2005,Query-driven visualization of large data sets - IEEE Conference Publication,"We present a practical and general-purpose approach to large and complex visual data analysis where visualization processing, rendering and subsequent human interpretation is constrained to the subset of data deemed interesting by the user. In many scientific data analysis applications, \""interesting\"" data can be defined by compound Boolean range queries of the form (temperature>1000) AND (70<pressure<90). As data sizes grow larger, a central challenge is to answer such queries as efficiently as possible. Prior work in the visualization community has focused on answering range queries for scalar fields within the context of accelerating the search phase of isosurface algorithms. In contrast, our work describes an approach that leverages state-of-the-art indexing technology from the scientific data management community called \""bitmap indexing\"". Our implementation, which we call \""DEX\"" (short for dextrous data explorer), uses bitmap indexing to efficiently answer multivariate, multidimensional data queries to provide input to a visualization pipeline. We present an analysis overview and benchmark results that show bitmap indexing offers significant storage and performance improvements when compared to previous approaches for accelerating the search phase of isosurface algorithms. More importantly, since bitmap indexing supports complex multidimensional, multivariate range queries, it is more generally applicable to scientific data visualization and analysis problems. In addition to benchmark performance and analysis, we apply DEX to a typical scientific visualization problem encountered in combustion simulation data analysis.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2005.1532792
Ambient Visualization,Vis,2005,Differential protein expression analysis via liquid-chromatography/mass- spectrometry data visualization - IEEE Conference Publication,"Differential protein expression analysis is one of the main challenges in proteomics. It denotes the search for proteins, whose encoding genes are differentially expressed under a given experimental setup. An important task in this context is to identify the differentially expressed proteins or, more generally, all proteins present in the sample. One of the most promising and recently widely used approaches for protein identification is to cleave proteins into peptides, separate the peptides using liquid chromatography, and determine the masses of the separated peptides using mass spectrometry. The resulting data needs to be analyzed and matched against protein sequence databases. The analysis step is typically done by searching for intensity peaks in a large number of 2D graphs. We present an interactive visualization tool for the exploration of liquid-chromatography/mass- spectrometry data in a 3D space, which allows for the understanding of the data in its entirety and a detailed analysis of regions of interest. We compute differential expression over the liquid-chromatography/mass- spectrometry domain and embed it visually in our system.

One such example is a simulation of injection systems that is becoming more and more important due to an increasingly restrictive emission regulations. There are many parameters and correlations among them that influence the simulation results. We describe how basic information visualization techniques can help in visualizing, understanding and analyzing this kind of data.

Too often, successful decision-making and analysis are more a matter of serendipity and user experience than of intentional design and specific support for such tasks; although humans have considerable abilities in analyzing relationships from data, the utility of visualizations remains relatively variable across users, data sets, and domains. In this paper, we discuss the notion of analytic gaps, which represent obstacles faced by visualizations in facilitating higher-level analytic tasks, such as decision- making and learning.

In response, a wide variety of visualization tools have been created to facilitate data analysis. Biologists often face a dilemma in choosing the best tool for their situation. The tool that works best for one biologist may not work well for another due to differences in the type of insight they seek from their data. A primary purpose of a visualization tool is to provide domain-relevant insight into the data. Ideally, any user wants maximum information in the least possible time. In this paper we identify several distinct characteristics of insight that enable us to recognize and quantify it. Based on this, we empirically evaluate five popular microarray visualization tools.

The 3D scalar field data sets fall into two categories: dendritic plasma membranes (defining the structure) and immunofluorescent staining (defining protein concentration along the structure). ImageSurfer enables scientists to analyze relationships between multiple data sets obtained with confocal microscopy by providing 3D surface view, height field, and graphing tools. Each tool reduces the complexity of the problem by extracting a restricted subset of data: finding a region of interest in 3D; getting a sense of relative concentrations in 2D, and getting exact concentration values in 1D. The current design is presented, along with the rationale for each design decision. The tool is already proving useful for data exploration, analysis, and presentation.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2004.46
Ambient Visualization,InfoVis,2003,Exploring high-D spaces with multiform matrices and small multiples - IEEE Conference Publication,"We introduce an approach to visual analysis of multivariate data that integrates several methods from information visualization, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and geovisualization. The approach leverages the component-based architecture implemented in GeoVISTA Studio to construct a flexible, multiview, tightly (but generically) coordinated, EDA toolkit. This toolkit builds upon traditional ideas behind both small multiples and scatterplot matrices in three fundamental ways. First, we develop a general, multiform, bivariate matrix and a complementary multiform, bivariate small multiple plot in which different bivariate representation forms can be used in combination. We demonstrate the flexibility of this approach with matrices and small multiples that depict multivariate data through combinations of: scatterplots, bivariate maps, and space-filling displays. Second, we apply a measure of conditional entropy to (a) identify variables from a high-dimensional data set that are likely to display interesting relationships and (b) generate a default order of these variables in the matrix or small multiple display. Third, we add conditioning, a kind of dynamic query/filtering in which supplementary (undisplayed) variables are used to constrain the view onto variables that are displayed. Conditioning allows the effects of one or more well understood variables to be removed form the analysis, making relationships among remaining variables easier to explore. We illustrate the individual and combined functionality enabled by this approach through application to analysis of cancer diagnosis and mortality data and their associated covariates and risk factors.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/INFVIS.2003.1249006
Ambient Visualization,Vis,2003,Volume tracking using higher dimensional isosurfacing - IEEE Conference Publication,"Tracking and visualizing local features from a time-varying volumetric data allows the user to focus on selected regions of interest, both in space and time, which can lead to a better understanding of the underlying dynamics. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm to track time-varying isosurfaces and interval volumes using isosurfacing in higher dimensions. Instead of extracting the data features such as isosurfaces or interval volumes separately from multiple time steps and computing the spatial correspondence between those features, our algorithm extracts the correspondence directly from the higher dimensional geometry and thus can more efficiently follow the user selected local features in time. In addition, by analyzing the resulting higher dimensional geometry, it becomes easier to detect important topological events and the corresponding critical time steps for the selected features. With our algorithm, the user can interact with the underlying time-varying data more easily. The computation cost for performing time-varying volume tracking is also minimized.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2003.1250374
Ambient Visualization,Vis,2002,Exploring scalar fields using critical isovalues - IEEE Conference Publication,"Isosurfaces are commonly used to visualize scalar fields. Critical isovalues indicate isosurface topology changes: the creation of new surface components, merging of surface components or the formation of holes in a surface component. Therefore, they highlight interesting isosurface behavior and are helpful in exploration of large trivariate data sets. We present a method that detects critical isovalues in a scalar field defined by piecewise trilinear interpolation over a rectilinear grid and describe how to use them when examining volume data. We further review varieties of the marching cubes (MC) algorithm, with the intention of preserving topology of the trilinear interpolant when extracting an isosurface. We combine and extend two approaches in such a way that it is possible to extract meaningful isosurfaces even when a critical value is chosen as the isovalue.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2002.1183772
Ambient Visualization,InfoVis,1999,Navigating hierarchies with structure-based brushes - IEEE Conference Publication,"Interactive selection is a critical component in exploratory visualization, allowing users to isolate subsets of the displayed information for highlighting, deleting, analysis, or focussed investigation. Brushing, a popular method for implementing the selection process, has traditionally been performed in either screen space or data space. We introduce the concept of a structure-based brush, which can be used to perform selection in hierarchically structured data sets. Our structure- based brush allows users to navigate hierarchies by specifying focal extents and level-of-detail on a visual representation of the structure. Proximity- based coloring, which maps similar colors to data that are closely related within the structure, helps convey both structural relationships and anomalies. We describe the design and implementation of our structure-based brushing tool. We also validate its usefulness using two distinct hierarchical visualization techniques, namely hierarchical parallel coordinates and tree- maps.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/INFVIS.1999.801858
Ambient Visualization,Vis,1999,A framework for assisted exploration with collaboration - IEEE Conference Publication,"We approach the problem of exploring a virtual space by exploiting positional and camera-model constraints on navigation to provide extra assistance that focuses the user's explorational wanderings on the task objectives. Our specific design incorporates not only task-based constraints on the viewer's location, gaze, and viewing parameters, but also a personal \""glide\"" that serves two important functions: keeping the user oriented in the navigation space, and \""pointing\"" to interesting subject areas as they are approached. The guide's cues may be ignored by continuing in motion, but if the user stops, the gaze shifts automatically toward whatever the guide was interested in. This design has the serendipitous feature that it automatically incorporates a nested collaborative paradigm simply by allowing any given viewer to be seen as the \""guide\"" of one or more viewers following behind; the leading automated guide (we tend to select a guide dog for this avatar) can remind the leading live human guide of interesting sites to point out, while each real human collaborator down the chain has some choices about whether to follow the local leader's hints. We have chosen VRML as our initial development medium primarily because of its portability, and we have implemented a variety of natural modes for leading and collaborating, including ways for collaborators to attach to and detach from a particular leader.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1999.809893

The paper presents several novel visual methods from an information analyst's perspective. The authors present a sample scenario, using the various methods to gain a variety of insights from a large information collection. They conclude that no single paradigm or visual method is sufficient for many analytical tasks. Often a suite of integrated methods offers a better analytic environment in today's emerging culture of information overload and rapidly changing issues. They also conclude that the interactions among these visual paradigms are equally as important as, if not more important than, the paradigms themselves.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/INFVIS.1998.729570
Ambient Visualization,Vis,1998,Image-based transfer function design for data exploration in volume visualization - IEEE Conference Publication,"Transfer function design is an integrated component in volume visualization and data exploration. The common trial-and-error approach for transfer function searching is a very difficult and time consuming process. A goal oriented and parameterized transfer function model is therefore crucial in guiding the transfer function searching process for better and more meaningful visualization results. The paper presents an image based transfer function model that integrates 3D image processing tools into the volume visualization pipeline to facilitate the search for an image based transfer function in volume data visualization and exploration. The model defines a transfer function as a sequence of 3D image processing procedures, and allows the users to adjust a set of qualitative and descriptive parameters to achieve their subjective visualization goals. 3D image enhancement and boundary detection tools, and their integration methods with volume visualization algorithms are described. The application of this approach for 3D microscopy data exploration and analysis is also discussed.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1998.745319

It is now appropriate to describe and analyze portions of the design space so as to understand the differences among designs and to suggest new possibilities. This paper proposes an organization of the information visualization literature and illustrates it with a series of examples.

Ambient Visualization,Vis,1996,Cheops: a compact explorer for complex hierarchies - IEEE Conference Publication,"As the amount of electronic information explodes, hierarchies to handle this information become huge and complex. Visualizing and interacting with these hierarchies become daunting tasks. The problem is exacerbated if the visualization is to be done on mass- market personal computers, with limited processing power and visual resolution. Many of the current visualization techniques work effectively for hierarchies of 1000 nodes, but as the number of nodes increases toward 5000, these techniques tend to break down. Hierarchies above 5000 nodes usually require special modifications such as clustering, which can affect visual stability. This paper introduces Cheops, a novel approach to the representation, browsing and exploration of huge, complex information hierarchies such as the Dewey Decimal Classification system, which can contain between a million and a billion nodes. The Cheops approach maintains context within a huge hierarchy, while simultaneously providing easy access to details. This paper presents some preliminary results from usability tests performed on an 8-wide-by-9-deep classification hierarchy, which if fully populated would contain over 19 million nodes.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1996.567745
Analysis Process - General,InfoVis,2015,Visual Mementos: Reflecting Memories with Personal Data,"In this paper we discuss the creation of visual mementos as a new application area for visualization. We define visual mementos as visualizations of personally relevant data for the purpose of reminiscing, and sharing of life experiences. Today more people collect digital information about their life than ever before. The shift from physical to digital archives poses new challenges and opportunities for self- reflection and self-representation. Drawing on research on autobiographical memory and on the role of artifacts in reminiscing, we identified design challenges for visual mementos: mapping data to evoke familiarity, expressing subjectivity, and obscuring sensitive details for sharing. Visual mementos can make use of the known strengths of visualization in revealing patterns to show the familiar instead of the unexpected, and extend representational mappings beyond the objective to include the more subjective. To understand whether people's subjective views on their past can be reflected in a visual representation, we developed, deployed and studied a technology probe that exemplifies our concept of visual mementos. Our results show how reminiscing has been supported and reveal promising new directions for self-reflection and sharing through visual mementos of personal experiences.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467831
Analysis Process - General,InfoVis,2015,"Visualization, Selection, and Analysis of Traffic Flows","Visualization of the trajectories of moving objects leads to dense and cluttered images, which hinders exploration and understanding. It also hinders adding additional visual information, such as direction, and makes it difficult to interactively extract traffic flows, i.e., subsets of trajectories. In this paper we present our approach to visualize traffic flows and provide interaction tools to support their exploration. We show an overview of the traffic using a density map. The directions of traffic flows are visualized using a particle system on top of the density map. The user can extract traffic flows using a novel selection widget that allows for the intuitive selection of an area, and filtering on a range of directions and any additional attributes. Using simple, visual set expressions, the user can construct more complicated selections. The dynamic behaviors of selected flows may then be shown in annotation windows in which they can be interactively explored and compared. We validate our approach through use cases where we explore and analyze the temporal behavior of aircraft and vessel trajectories, e.g., landing and takeoff sequences, or the evolution of flight route density. The aircraft use cases have been developed and validated in collaboration with domain experts.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467112
Analysis Process - General,VAST,2015,Interactive Visual Discovering of Movement Patterns from Sparsely Sampled Geo- tagged Social Media Data,"Social media data with geotags can be used to track people's movements in their daily lives. By providing both rich text and movement information, visual analysis on social media data can be both interesting and challenging. In contrast to traditional movement data, the sparseness and irregularity of social media data increase the difficulty of extracting movement patterns. To facilitate the understanding of people's movements, we present an interactive visual analytics system to support the exploration of sparsely sampled trajectory data from social media. We propose a heuristic model to reduce the uncertainty caused by the nature of social media data. In the proposed system, users can filter and select reliable data from each derived movement category, based on the guidance of uncertainty model and interactive selection tools. By iteratively analyzing filtered movements, users can explore the semantics of movements, including the transportation methods, frequent visiting sequences and keyword descriptions. We provide two cases to demonstrate how our system can help users to explore the movement patterns.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467619
Analysis Process - General,VAST,2015,MotionFlow: Visual Abstraction and Aggregation of Sequential Patterns in Human Motion Tracking Data,"Pattern analysis of human motions, which is useful in many research areas, requires understanding and comparison of different styles of motion patterns. However, working with human motion tracking data to support such analysis poses great challenges. In this paper, we propose MotionFlow, a visual analytics system that provides an effective overview of various motion patterns based on an interactive flow visualization. This visualization formulates a motion sequence as transitions between static poses, and aggregates these sequences into a tree diagram to construct a set of motion patterns. The system also allows the users to directly reflect the context of data and their perception of pose similarities in generating representative pose states. We provide local and global controls over the partition-based clustering process. To support the users in organizing unstructured motion data into pattern groups, we designed a set of interactions that enables searching for similar motion sequences from the data, detailed exploration of data subsets, and creating and modifying the group of motion patterns. To evaluate the usability of MotionFlow, we conducted a user study with six researchers with expertise in gesture-based interaction design. They used MotionFlow to explore and organize unstructured motion tracking data. Results show that the researchers were able to easily learn how to use MotionFlow, and the system effectively supported their pattern analysis activities, including leveraging their perception and domain knowledge.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2468292
Analysis Process - General,VAST,2015,MobilityGraphs: Visual Analysis of Mass Mobility Dynamics via Spatio-Temporal Graphs and Clustering,"Learning more about people mobility is an important task for official decision makers and urban planners. Mobility data sets characterize the variation of the presence of people in different places over time as well as movements (or flows) of people between the places. The analysis of mobility data is challenging due to the need to analyze and compare spatial situations (i.e., presence and flows of people at certain time moments) and to gain an understanding of the spatio- temporal changes (variations of situations over time). Traditional flow visualizations usually fail due to massive clutter. Modern approaches offer limited support for investigating the complex variation of the movements over longer time periods. We propose a visual analytics methodology that solves these issues by combined spatial and temporal simplifications. We have developed a graph-based method, called MobilityGraphs, which reveals movement patterns that were occluded in flow maps. Our method enables the visual representation of the spatio-temporal variation of movements for long time series of spatial situations originally containing a large number of intersecting flows. The interactive system supports data exploration from various perspectives and at various levels of detail by interactive setting of clustering parameters. The feasibility our approach was tested on aggregated mobility data derived from a set of geolocated Twitter posts within the Greater London city area and mobile phone call data records in Abidjan, Ivory Coast. We could show that MobilityGraphs support the identification of regular daily and weekly movement patterns of resident population.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2468111
Analysis Process - General,InfoVis,2014,The Not-so-Staggering Effect of Staggered Animated Transitions on Visual Tracking,"Interactive visual applications often rely on animation to transition from one display state to another. There are multiple animation techniques to choose from, and it is not always clear which should produce the best visual correspondences between display elements. One major factor is whether the animation relies on staggering-an incremental delay in start times across the moving elements. It has been suggested that staggering may reduce occlusion, while also reducing display complexity and producing less overwhelming animations, though no empirical evidence has demonstrated these advantages. Work in perceptual psychology does show that reducing occlusion, and reducing inter-object proximity (crowding) more generally, improves performance in multiple object tracking. We ran simulations confirming that staggering can in some cases reduce crowding in animated transitions involving dot clouds (as found in, e.g., animated 2D scatterplots). We empirically evaluated the effect of two staggering techniques on tracking tasks, focusing on cases that should most favour staggering. We found that introducing staggering has a negligible, or even negative, impact on multiple object tracking performance. The potential benefits of staggering may be outweighed by strong costs: a loss of common- motion grouping information about which objects travel in similar paths, and less predictability about when any specific object would begin to move. Staggering may be beneficial in some conditions, but they have yet to be demonstrated. The present results are a significant step toward a better understanding of animation pacing, and provide direction for further research.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346424
Analysis Process - General,InfoVis,2014,Moving beyond sequential design: Reflections on a rich multi-channel approach to data visualization,"We reflect on a four-year engagement with transport authorities and others involving a large dataset describing the use of a public bicycle-sharing scheme. We describe the role visualization of these data played in fostering engagement with policy makers, transport operators, the transport research community, the museum and gallery sector and the general public. We identify each of these as `channels'-evolving relationships between producers and consumers of visualization-where traditional roles of the visualization expert and domain expert are blurred. In each case, we identify the different design decisions that were required to support each of these channels and the role played by the visualization process. Using chauffeured interaction with a flexible visual analytics system we demonstrate how insight was gained by policy makers into gendered spatio-temporal cycle behaviors, how this led to further insight into workplace commuting activity, group cycling behavior and explanations for street navigation choice. We demonstrate how this supported, and was supported by, the seemingly unrelated development of narrative-driven visualization via TEDx, of the creation and the setting of an art installation and the curating of digital and physical artefacts. We assert that existing models of visualization design, of tool/technique development and of insight generation do not adequately capture the richness of parallel engagement via these multiple channels of communication. We argue that developing multiple channels in parallel opens up opportunities for visualization design and analysis by building trust and authority and supporting creativity. This rich, non- sequential approach to visualization design is likely to foster serendipity, deepen insight and increase impact.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346323
Analysis Process - General,InfoVis,2013,DiffAni: Visualizing Dynamic Graphs with a Hybrid of Difference Maps and Animation,"Visualization of dynamically changing networks (graphs) is a significant challenge for researchers. Previous work has experimentally compared animation, small multiples, and other techniques, and found trade-offs between these. One potential way to avoid such trade-offs is to combine previous techniques in a hybrid visualization. We present two taxonomies of visualizations of dynamic graphs: one of non-hybrid techniques, and one of hybrid techniques. We also describe a prototype, called DiffAni, that allows a graph to be visualized as a sequence of three kinds of tiles: diff tiles that show difference maps over some time interval, animation tiles that show the evolution of the graph over some time interval, and small multiple tiles that show the graph state at an individual time slice. This sequence of tiles is ordered by time and covers all time slices in the data. An experimental evaluation of DiffAni shows that our hybrid approach has advantages over non-hybrid techniques in certain cases.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2013.149
Analysis Process - General,InfoVis,2013,Information Visualization and Proxemics: Design Opportunities and Empirical Findings,"People typically interact with information visualizations using a mouse. Their physical movement, orientation, and distance to visualizations are rarely used as input. We explore how to use such spatial relations among people and visualizations (i.e., proxemics) to drive interaction with visualizations, focusing here on the spatial relations between a single user and visualizations on a large display. We implement interaction techniques that zoom and pan, query and relate, and adapt visualizations based on tracking of users' position in relation to a large high-resolution display. Alternative prototypes are tested in three user studies and compared with baseline conditions that use a mouse. Our aim is to gain empirical data on the usefulness of a range of design possibilities and to generate more ideas. Among other things, the results show promise for changing zoom level or visual representation with the user's physical distance to a large display. We discuss possible benefits and potential issues to avoid when designing information visualizations that use proxemics.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2013.166
Analysis Process - General,VAST,2013,MotionExplorer: Exploratory Search in Human Motion Capture Data Based on Hierarchical Aggregation,"We present MotionExplorer, an exploratory search and analysis system for sequences of human motion in large motion capture data collections. This special type of multivariate time series data is relevant in many research fields including medicine, sports and animation. Key tasks in working with motion data include analysis of motion states and transitions, and synthesis of motion vectors by interpolation and combination. In the practice of research and application of human motion data, challenges exist in providing visual summaries and drill-down functionality for handling large motion data collections. We find that this domain can benefit from appropriate visual retrieval and analysis support to handle these tasks in presence of large motion data. To address this need, we developed MotionExplorer together with domain experts as an exploratory search system based on interactive aggregation and visualization of motion states as a basis for data navigation, exploration, and search. Based on an overview-first type visualization, users are able to search for interesting sub-sequences of motion based on a query- by-example metaphor, and explore search results by details on demand. We developed MotionExplorer in close collaboration with the targeted users who are researchers working on human motion synthesis and analysis, including a summative field study. Additionally, we conducted a laboratory design study to substantially improve MotionExplorer towards an intuitive, usable and robust design. MotionExplorer enables the search in human motion capture data with only a few mouse clicks. The researchers unanimously confirm that the system can efficiently support their work.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2013.178
Analysis Process - General,VAST,2013,Space Transformation for Understanding Group Movement,"We suggest a methodology for analyzing movement behaviors of individuals moving in a group. Group movement is analyzed at two levels of granularity: the group as a whole and the individuals it comprises. For analyzing the relative positions and movements of the individuals with respect to the rest of the group, we apply space transformation, in which the trajectories of the individuals are converted from geographical space to an abstract 'group space'. The group space reference system is defined by both the position of the group center, which is taken as the coordinate origin, and the direction of the group's movement. Based on the individuals' positions mapped onto the group space, we can compare the behaviors of different individuals, determine their roles and/or ranks within the groups, and, possibly, understand how group movement is organized. The utility of the methodology has been evaluated by applying it to a set of real data concerning movements of wild social animals and discussing the results with experts in animal ethology.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2013.193
Analysis Process - General,Vis,2013,A Multi-Criteria Approach to Camera Motion Design for Volume Data Animation,"We present an integrated camera motion design and path generation system for building volume data animations. Creating animations is an essential task in presenting complex scientific visualizations. Existing visualization systems use an established animation function based on keyframes selected by the user. This approach is limited in providing the optimal in-between views of the data. Alternatively, computer graphics and virtual reality camera motion planning is frequently focused on collision free movement in a virtual walkthrough. For semi-transparent, fuzzy, or blobby volume data the collision free objective becomes insufficient. Here, we provide a set of essential criteria focused on computing camera paths to establish effective animations of volume data. Our dynamic multi-criteria solver coupled with a force-directed routing algorithm enables rapid generation of camera paths. Once users review the resulting animation and evaluate the camera motion, they are able to determine how each criterion impacts path generation. In this paper, we demonstrate how incorporating this animation approach with an interactive volume visualization system reduces the effort in creating context-aware and coherent animations. This frees the user to focus on visualization tasks with the objective of gaining additional insight from the volume data.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2013.123
Analysis Process - General,InfoVis,2012,How Capacity Limits of Attention Influence Information Visualization Effectiveness,"In this paper, we explore how the capacity limits of attention influence the effectiveness of information visualizations. We conducted a series of experiments to test how visual feature type (color vs. motion), layout, and variety of visual elements impacted user performance. The experiments tested users' abilities to (1) determine if a specified target is on the screen, (2) detect an odd-ball, deviant target, different from the other visible objects, and (3) gain a qualitative overview by judging the number of unique categories on the screen. Our results show that the severe capacity limits of attention strongly modulate the effectiveness of information visualizations, particularly the ability to detect unexpected information. Keeping in mind these capacity limits, we conclude with a set of design guidelines which depend on a visualization's intended use.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2012.233
Analysis Process - General,InfoVis,2012,PivotPaths: Strolling through Faceted Information Spaces,"We present PivotPaths, an interactive visualization for exploring faceted information resources. During both work and leisure, we increasingly interact with information spaces that contain multiple facets and relations, such as authors, keywords, and citations of academic publications, or actors and genres of movies. To navigate these interlinked resources today, one typically selects items from facet lists resulting in abrupt changes from one subset of data to another. While filtering is useful to retrieve results matching specific criteria, it can be difficult to see how facets and items relate and to comprehend the effect of filter operations. In contrast, the PivotPaths interface exposes faceted relations as visual paths in arrangements that invite the viewer to `take a stroll' through an information space. PivotPaths supports pivot operations as lightweight interaction techniques that trigger gradual transitions between views. We designed the interface to allow for casual traversal of large collections in an aesthetically pleasing manner that encourages exploration and serendipitous discoveries. This paper shares the findings from our iterative design-and-evaluation process that included semi-structured interviews and a two-week deployment of PivotPaths applied to a large database of academic publications.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2012.252
Analysis Process - General,InfoVis,2012,Stacking-Based Visualization of Trajectory Attribute Data,"Visualizing trajectory attribute data is challenging because it involves showing the trajectories in their spatio-temporal context as well as the attribute values associated with the individual points of trajectories. Previous work on trajectory visualization addresses selected aspects of this problem, but not all of them. We present a novel approach to visualizing trajectory attribute data. Our solution covers space, time, and attribute values. Based on an analysis of relevant visualization tasks, we designed the visualization solution around the principle of stacking trajectory bands. The core of our approach is a hybrid 2D/3D display. A 2D map serves as a reference for the spatial context, and the trajectories are visualized as stacked 3D trajectory bands along which attribute values are encoded by color. Time is integrated through appropriate ordering of bands and through a dynamic query mechanism that feeds temporally aggregated information to a circular time display. An additional 2D time graph shows temporal information in full detail by stacking 2D trajectory bands. Our solution is equipped with analytical and interactive mechanisms for selecting and ordering of trajectories, and adjusting the color mapping, as well as coordinated highlighting and dedicated 3D navigation. We demonstrate the usefulness of our novel visualization by three examples related to radiation surveillance, traffic analysis, and maritime navigation. User feedback obtained in a small experiment indicates that our hybrid 2D/3D solution can be operated quite well.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2012.265
Analysis Process - General,VAST,2012,Visual Analytics Methodology for Eye Movement Studies,"Eye movement analysis is gaining popularity as a tool for evaluation of visual displays and interfaces. However, the existing methods and tools for analyzing eye movements and scanpaths are limited in terms of the tasks they can support and effectiveness for large data and data with high variation. We have performed an extensive empirical evaluation of a broad range of visual analytics methods used in analysis of geographic movement data. The methods have been tested for the applicability to eye tracking data and the capability to extract useful knowledge about users' viewing behaviors. This allowed us to select the suitable methods and match them to possible analysis tasks they can support.

Analysis Process - General,Vis,2012,Derived Metric Tensors for Flow Surface Visualization,"Integral flow surfaces constitute a widely used flow visualization tool due to their capability to convey important flow information such as fluid transport, mixing, and domain segmentation. Current flow surface rendering techniques limit their expressiveness, however, by focusing virtually exclusively on displacement visualization, visually neglecting the more complex notion of deformation such as shearing and stretching that is central to the field of continuum mechanics. To incorporate this information into the flow surface visualization and analysis process, we derive a metric tensor field that encodes local surface deformations as induced by the velocity gradient of the underlying flow field. We demonstrate how properties of the resulting metric tensor field are capable of enhancing present surface visualization and generation methods and develop novel surface querying, sampling, and visualization techniques. The provided results show how this step towards unifying classic flow visualization and more advanced concepts from continuum mechanics enables more detailed and improved flow analysis.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2012.211
Analysis Process - General,InfoVis,2011,Composite Density Maps for Multivariate Trajectories,"We consider moving objects as multivariate time-series. By visually analyzing the attributes, patterns may appear that explain why certain movements have occurred. Density maps as proposed by Scheepens et al. [25] are a way to reveal these patterns by means of aggregations of filtered subsets of trajectories. Since filtering is often not sufficient for analysts to express their domain knowledge, we propose to use expressions instead. We present a flexible architecture for density maps to enable custom, versatile exploration using multiple density fields. The flexibility comes from a script, depicted in this paper as a block diagram, which defines an advanced computation of a density field. We define six different types of blocks to create, compose, and enhance trajectories or density fields. Blocks are customized by means of expressions that allow the analyst to model domain knowledge. The versatility of our architecture is demonstrated with several maritime use cases developed with domain experts. Our approach is expected to be useful for the analysis of objects in other domains.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2011.181
Analysis Process - General,VAST,2011,From movement tracks through events to places: Extracting and characterizing significant places from mobility data - IEEE Conference Publication,"We propose a visual analytics procedure for analyzing movement data, i.e., recorded tracks of moving objects. It is oriented to a class of problems where it is required to determine significant places on the basis of certain types of events occurring repeatedly in movement data. The procedure consists of four major steps: (1) event extraction from trajectories; (2) event clustering and extraction of relevant places; (3) spatio-temporal aggregation of events or trajectories; (4) analysis of the aggregated data. All steps are scalable with respect to the amount of the data under analysis. We demonstrate the use of the procedure by example of two real-world problems requiring analysis at different spatial scales.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2011.6102454
Analysis Process - General,InfoVis,2009,FromDaDy: Spreading Aircraft Trajectories Across Views to Support Iterative Queries,"When displaying thousands of aircraft trajectories on a screen, the visualization is spoiled by a tangle of trails. The visual analysis is therefore difficult, especially if a specific class of trajectories in an erroneous dataset has to be studied. We designed FromDaDy, a trajectory visualization tool that tackles the difficulties of exploring the visualization of multiple trails. This multidimensional data exploration is based on scatterplots, brushing, pick and drop, juxtaposed views and rapid visual design. Users can organize the workspace composed of multiple juxtaposed views. They can define the visual configuration of the views by connecting data dimensions from the dataset to Bertin's visual variables. They can then brush trajectories, and with a pick and drop operation they can spread the brushed information across views. They can then repeat these interactions, until they extract a set of relevant data, thus formulating complex queries. Through two real-world scenarios, we show how FromDaDy supports iterative queries and the extraction of trajectories in a dataset that contains up to 5 million data.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2009.145
Analysis Process - General,InfoVis,2009,GeneShelf: A Web-based Visual Interface for Large Gene Expression Time-Series Data Repositories,"A widespread use of high-throughput gene expression analysis techniques enabled the biomedical research community to share a huge body of gene expression datasets in many public databases on the web. However, current gene expression data repositories provide static representations of the data and support limited interactions. This hinders biologists from effectively exploring shared gene expression datasets. Responding to the growing need for better interfaces to improve the utility of the public datasets, we have designed and developed a new web-based visual interface entitled GeneShelf (http://bioinformatics.cnmcresearch.org/GeneShelf). It builds upon a zoomable grid display to represent two categorical dimensions. It also incorporates an augmented timeline with expandable time points that better shows multiple data values for the focused time point by embedding bar charts. We applied GeneShelf to one of the largest microarray datasets generated to study the progression and recovery process of injuries at the spinal cord of mice and rats. We present a case study and a preliminary qualitative user study with biologists to show the utility and usability of GeneShelf.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2009.146
Analysis Process - General,VAST,2009,Proximity-based visualization of movement trace data - IEEE Conference Publication,"The increasing availability of motion sensors and video cameras in living spaces has made possible the analysis of motion patterns and collective behavior in a number of situations. The visualization of this movement data, however, remains a challenge. Although maintaining the actual layout of the data space is often desirable, direct visualization of movement traces becomes cluttered and confusing as the spatial distribution of traces may be disparate and uneven. We present proximity-based visualization as a novel approach to the visualization of movement traces in an abstract space rather than the given spatial layout. This abstract space is obtained by considering proximity data, which is computed as the distance between entities and some number of important locations. These important locations can range from a single fixed point, to a moving point, several points, or even the proximities between the entities themselves. This creates a continuum of proximity spaces, ranging from the fixed absolute reference frame to completely relative reference frames. By combining these abstracted views with the concrete spatial views, we provide a way to mentally map the abstract spaces back to the real space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, and its applicability to visual analytics problems such as hazard prevention, migration patterns, and behavioral studies.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2009.5332593
Analysis Process - General,VAST,2009,Interactive visual clustering of large collections of trajectories - IEEE Conference Publication,"One of the most common operations in exploration and analysis of various kinds of data is clustering, i.e. discovery and interpretation of groups of objects having similar properties and/or behaviors. In clustering, objects are often treated as points in multi-dimensional space of properties. However, structurally complex objects, such as trajectories of moving entities and other kinds of spatio-temporal data, cannot be adequately represented in this manner. Such data require sophisticated and computationally intensive clustering algorithms, which are very hard to scale effectively to large datasets not fitting in the computer main memory. We propose an approach to extracting meaningful clusters from large databases by combining clustering and classification, which are driven by a human analyst through an interactive visual interface.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2009.5332584
Analysis Process - General,InfoVis,2008,Effectiveness of Animation in Trend Visualization,"Animation has been used to show trends in multi-dimensional data. This technique has recently gained new prominence for presentations, most notably with Gapminder Trendalyzer. In Trendalyzer, animation together with interesting data and an engaging presenter helps the audience understand the results of an analysis of the data. It is less clear whether trend animation is effective for analysis. This paper proposes two alternative trend visualizations that use static depictions of trends: one which shows traces of all trends overlaid simultaneously in one display and a second that uses a small multiples display to show the trend traces side-by- side. The paper evaluates the three visualizations for both analysis and presentation. Results indicate that trend animation can be challenging to use even for presentations; while it is the fastest technique for presentation and participants find it enjoyable and exciting, it does lead to many participant errors. Animation is the least effective form for analysis; both static depictions of trends are significantly faster than animation, and the small multiples display is more accurate.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2008.125

This paper reports the results of collaborative synthesis experiments conducted with expert geographers and disease biologists. Ten participants were worked in pairs to complete a simulated real-world synthesis task using artifacts printed on cards on a large, paper-covered workspace. Experiment results indicate that groups use a number of different approaches to collaborative synthesis, and that they employ a variety of organizational metaphors to structure their information. It is further evident that establishing common ground and role assignment are critical aspects of collaborative synthesis.

Traditional approaches to visualization and interactive exploration of movement data cannot cope with data of such sizes. In this research paper we investigate the ways of using aggregation for visual analysis of movement data. We define aggregation methods suitable for movement data and find visualization and interaction techniques to represent results of aggregations and enable comprehensive exploration of the data. We consider two possible views of movement, traffic-oriented and trajectory-oriented. Each view requires different methods of analysis and of data aggregation.

Multi-resolution navigation is supported via a hierarchical time structure as well as a hierarchical theme structure. Themes can be explored hierarchically according to their thematic structure, or in an unstructured fashion using various ranking criteria.

The multi-scale and location specific nature of behavior patterns in space and time is captured using a wavelet- based feature descriptor. The system learns the fundamental descriptions of the behavior patterns in a semi-supervised fashion by the higher order singular value decomposition of the space described by the training data. This training process is guided and refined by the users in an intuitive fashion. Anomalies are detected by projecting the test data into this multi-linear space and are visualized by the system to direct the attention of the user to potential problem spots.

However, extracting such useful relationships without user guidance is cumbersome and often an error prone process. In this paper, we present a visual analysis system that interactively discovers such relationships from the trajectories of derived features. We describe analysis algorithms to derive various spatial and spatio-temporal relationships. A visual interface is presented using which the user can interactively select spatial and temporal extents to guide the knowledge discovery process. We show the usefulness of our proposed algorithms on datasets originating from computational fluid dynamics. We also demonstrate how the derived relationships can help in explaining the occurrence of critical events like merging and bifurcation of the vortices",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2006.261451
Analysis Process - General,Vis,2006,A Trajectory-Preserving Synchronization Method for Collaborative Visualization,"In the past decade, a lot of research work has been conducted to support collaborative visualization among remote users over the networks, allowing them to visualize and manipulate shared data for problem solving. There are many applications of collaborative visualization, such as oceanography, meteorology and medical science. To facilitate user interaction, a critical system requirement for collaborative visualization is to ensure that remote users would perceive a synchronized view of the shared data. Failing this requirement, the user's ability in performing the desirable collaborative tasks would be affected. In this paper, we propose a synchronization method to support collaborative visualization. It considers how interaction with dynamic objects is perceived by application participants under the existence of network latency, and remedies the motion trajectory of the dynamic objects. It also handles the false positive and false negative collision detection problems. The new method is particularly well designed for handling content changes due to unpredictable user interventions or object collisions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through a number of experiments",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2006.114

Location, color, movement, and spatial distance of objects in the visual space are used to represent the semantic relationships between a query and relevant Web pages. Especially, the movement of objects and their speeds add a new dimension to the visual space, illustrating the degree of relevance among a query and Web search results in the context of users' subjects of interest. By interacting with the visual space, users are able to observe the semantic relevance between a query and a resulting Web page with respect to their subjects of interest, context information, or concern.

Analysis Process - General,InfoVis,2005,An optimization-based approach to dynamic visual context management - IEEE Conference Publication,"We are building an intelligent multimodal conversation system to aid users in exploring large and complex data sets. To tailor to diverse user queries introduced during a conversation, we automate the generation of system responses, including both spoken and visual outputs. In this paper, we focus on the problem of visual context management, a process that dynamically updates an existing visual display to effectively incorporate new information requested by subsequent user queries. Specifically, we develop an optimization based approach to visual context management. Compared to existing approaches, which normally handle predictable visual context updates, our work offers two unique contributions. First, we provide a general computational framework that can effectively manage a visual context for diverse, unanticipated situations encountered in a user system conversation. Moreover, we optimize the satisfaction of both semantic and visual constraints, which otherwise are difficult to balance using simple heuristics. Second, we present an extensible representation model that uses feature based metrics to uniformly define all constraints.

Analysis Process - General,InfoVis,2005,Revealing structure within clustered parallel coordinates displays - IEEE Conference Publication,"In order to gain insight into multivariate data, complex structures must be analysed and understood. Parallel coordinates is an excellent tool for visualizing this type of data but has its limitations. This paper deals with one of its main limitations - how to visualize a large number of data items without hiding the inherent structure they constitute. We solve this problem by constructing clusters and using high precision textures to represent them. We also use transfer functions that operate on the high precision textures in order to highlight different aspects of the cluster characteristics. Providing predefined transfer functions as well as the support to draw customized transfer functions makes it possible to extract different aspects of the data. We also show how feature animation can be used as guidance when simultaneously analysing several clusters. This technique makes it possible to visually represent statistical information about clusters and thus guides the user, making the analysis process more efficient.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/INFVIS.2005.1532138

Instead, we share the visualization resources with the graph and present the label information in static, interactive, and dynamic modes without the requirement for tackling the intractability issues. This allows us to reallocate the computational resources for dynamic presentation of real time information.

Analysis Process - General,Vis,2005,Dataset traversal with motion-controlled transfer functions - IEEE Conference Publication,"In this paper, we describe a methodology and implementation for interactive dataset traversal using motion- controlled transfer functions. Dataset traversal here refers lo the process of translating a transfer function along a specific path. In scientific visualization, it is often necessary to manipulate transfer functions in order to visualize datasets more effectively. This manipulation of transfer functions is usually performed globally, i.e., a new transfer function is applied to the entire dataset. Our approach allows one to locally manipulate transfer functions while controling its movement along a traversal path. The method we propose allows the user to select a traversal path within the dataset, based on the shape of the volumetric model and manipulate a transfer function along this path. Examples of dataset traversal include the animation of transfer functions along a pre-defined path, the simulation of flow in vascular structures, and the visualization of convoluted shapes. For example, this type of traversal is often used in medical illustration to highlight flow in blood vessels. We present an interactive implementation of our method using graphics hardware, based on the decomposition of the volume. We show examples of our approach using a variety of volumetric datasets, and we also demonstrate that with our novel decomposition, the rendering process is faster.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2005.1532817

The algorithm works online and allows arbitrary modifications to the graph. It is generic and can be implemented using a wide range of static force-directed graph layout tools.

Analysis Process - General,InfoVis,2004,Time-Varying Data Visualization Using Information Flocking Boids - IEEE Conference Publication,"This research demonstrates how principles of self-organization and behavior simulation can be used to represent dynamic data evolutions by extending the concept of information flocking, originally introduced by Proctor & Winter (1998), to time-varying datasets. A rule-based behavior system continuously controls and updates the dynamic actions of individual, three-dimensional elements that represent the changing data values of reoccurring data objects. As a result, different distinguishable motion types emerge that are driven by local interactions between the spatial elements as well as the evolution of time- varying data values. Notably, this representation technique focuses on the representation of dynamic data alteration characteristics, or how reoccurring data objects change over time, instead of depicting the exact data values themselves. In addition, it demonstrates the potential of motion as a useful information visualization cue. The original information flocking approach is extended to incorporate time-varying datasets, live database querying, continuous data streaming, real-time data similarity evaluation, automatic shape generation and more stable flocking algorithms. Different experiments prove that information flocking is capable of representing short-term events as well as long-term temporal data evolutions of both individual and groups of time-dependent data objects.

Analysis Process - General,Vis,2004,Real-time motion estimation and visualization on graphics cards - IEEE Conference Publication,"We present a tool for real- time visualization of motion features in 2D image sequences. The motion is estimated through an eigenvector analysis of the spatio-temporal structure tensor at every pixel location. This approach is computationally demanding but allows reliable velocity estimates as well as quality indicators for the obtained results. We use a 2D color map and a region of interest selector for the visualization of the velocities. On the selected velocities we apply a hierarchical smoothing scheme which allows the choice of the desired scale of the motion field. We demonstrate several examples of test sequences in which some persons are moving with different velocities than others. These persons are visually marked in the real-time display of the image sequence. The tool is also applied to angiography sequences to emphasize the blood flow and its distribution. An efficient processing of the data streams is achieved by mapping the operations onto the stream architecture of standard graphics cards. The card receives the images and performs both the motion estimation and visualization, taking advantage of the parallelism in the graphics processor and the superior memory bandwidth. The integration of data processing and visualization also saves on unnecessary data transfers and thus allows the real-time analysis of 320/spl times/240 images.

The vertical motion found is typically associated with the variations of the thermocline depth over time, which are mainly a result of the development and movement of ocean fronts, eddies, and internal waves. A new technique, extended from Lagrangian-Eulerian Advection, is presented to help understand the variation of vertical motion associated with the change in thermocline depth over time. A time surface is correctly deformed in a single direction according to the flow. The evolution of the time surface is computed via a mixture of Eulerian and Lagrangian techniques. The dominant horizontal motion is textured onto the surface using texture advection, while both the horizontal and vertical motions are used to displace the surface.

Sampling with small time steps will result in the camouflage of interesting motions. In this case study, we discuss techniques for the interactive 3D visualization of the dynamics of the photoactive yellow protein.

The guide's cues may be ignored by continuing in motion, but if the user stops, the gaze shifts automatically toward whatever the guide was interested in. This design has the serendipitous feature that it automatically incorporates a nested collaborative paradigm simply by allowing any given viewer to be seen as the \""guide\"" of one or more viewers following behind; the leading automated guide (we tend to select a guide dog for this avatar) can remind the leading live human guide of interesting sites to point out, while each real human collaborator down the chain has some choices about whether to follow the local leader's hints.

The application of LIC to 3D flow fields has yet been limited by difficulties to efficiently display and animate the resulting 3D-images. Texture-based volume rendering allows interactive visualization and manipulation of 3D-LIC textures. In order to ensure the comprehensive and convenient exploration of flow fields, we suggest interactive functionality including transfer functions and different clipping mechanisms. Thereby, we efficiently substitute the calculation of LIC based on sparse noise textures and show the convenient visual access of interior structures. Further on, we introduce two approaches for animating static 3D-flow fields without the computational expense and the immense memory requirements for pre-computed 3D-textures and without loss of interactivity. This is achieved by using a single 3D-LIC texture and a set of time surfaces as clipping geometries. In our first approach we use the clipping geometry to pre-compute a special 3D-LIC texture that can be animated by time-dependent color tables. Our second approach uses time volumes to actually clip the 3D-LIC volume interactively during rasterization.

We impose a set of weak constraints that allows smooth interpolation between two keyframe hierarchies in an animation or, more generally, allows the interpolation in an n-parameter family of hierarchies. We use hierarchical triangulations obtained by the Rivara element bisection algorithm (M. Rivara, 1984) and impose a weak compatibility constraint on the set of root elements of all keyframe hierarchies. We show that the introduced constraints are rather weak. The strength of our approach is that the interpolation works in the class of conforming triangulations and simplifies the task of finding the intermediate hierarchy, which is the union of the two (or more) keyframe hierarchies involved in the interpolation process. This allows for an efficient generation of the intermediate connectivity and additionally ensures that the intermediate hierarchy is again a conforming hierarchy satisfying the same constraints.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1998.745328
Analysis Process - General,Vis,1998,Visualizing differences in movies of cortical activity - IEEE Conference Publication,"This paper discusses techniques for visualizing structure in video data and other data sets that represent time snapshots of physical phenomena. Individual frames of a movie are treated as vectors and projected onto a low-dimensional subspace spanned by principal components. Movies can be compared and their differences visualized by analyzing the nature of the subspace and the projections of multiple movies onto the same subspace. The approach is demonstrated on an application in neurobiology in which the electrical response of a visual cortex to optical stimulation is imaged onto a high-speed photodiode array to produce a cortical movie. Techniques for sampling movies over a single trial and multiple trials are discussed. The approach provides the traditional benefits of principal component analysis (compression, noise reduction and classification) and also allows the visual separation of spatial and temporal behavior.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1998.745306

We are developing software tools to support such investigations. There are two parts in this investigation, namely growth visualization of (i) a plant root and (ii) a plant stem. For both domains, the input data is a stream of images taken by cameras. The tools being developed make it possible to measure various time-varying quantities, such as differential growth.

An algorithm is presented that allows very rapid representation of an interval set surrounding an iso contour surface. The algorithm draws upon three main ideas. A fast indexing scheme is used to select only those data points near the contour surface. Hardware assisted splatting is then employed on these data points to produce a volume rendering of the interval set. Finally, by shifting a small window through the indexing scheme or data space, animated volumes are produced showing the changing contour values. In addition to allowing fast selection and rendering of the data, the indexing scheme allows a much compressed representation of the data by eliminating \""noise\"" data points.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1996.568119
Analysis Process - General,Vis,1996,UFLOW: visualizing uncertainty in fluid flow - IEEE Conference Publication,"Uncertainty or errors are introduced in fluid flow data as the data is acquired, transformed and rendered. Although researchers are aware of these uncertainties, little has been done to incorporate them in the existing visualization systems for fluid flow. In the absence of integrated presentation of data and its associated uncertainty, the analysis of the visualization is incomplete at best and may lead to inaccurate or incorrect conclusions. The article presents UFLOW-a system for visualizing uncertainty in fluid flow. Although there are several sources of uncertainties in fluid flow data, in this work, we focus on uncertainty arising from the use of different numerical algorithms for computing particle traces in a fluid flow. The techniques that we have employed to visualize uncertainty in fluid flow include uncertainty glyphs, flow envelopes, animations, priority sequences, twirling batons of trace viewpoints, and rakes. These techniques are effective in making the users aware of the effects of different integration methods and their sensitivity, especially near critical points in the flow field.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1996.568116
Animation and Motion,InfoVis,2015,A Linguistic Approach to Categorical Color Assignment for Data Visualization,"When data categories have strong color associations, it is useful to use these semantically meaningful concept-color associations in data visualizations. In this paper, we explore how linguistic information about the terms defining the data can be used to generate semantically meaningful colors. To do this effectively, we need first to establish that a term has a strong semantic color association, then discover which color or colors express it. Using co-occurrence measures of color name frequencies from Google n-grams, we define a measure for colorability that describes how strongly associated a given term is to any of a set of basic color terms. We then show how this colorability score can be used with additional semantic analysis to rank and retrieve a representative color from Google Images. Alternatively, we use symbolic relationships defined by WordNet to select identity colors for categories such as countries or brands. To create visually distinct color palettes, we use k-means clustering to create visually distinct sets, iteratively reassigning terms with multiple basic color associations as needed. This can be additionally constrained to use colors only in a predefined palette.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467471
Animation and Motion,InfoVis,2015,Speculative Practices: Utilizing InfoVis to Explore Untapped Literary Collections,"In this paper we exemplify how information visualization supports speculative thinking, hypotheses testing, and preliminary interpretation processes as part of literary research. While InfoVis has become a buzz topic in the digital humanities, skepticism remains about how effectively it integrates into and expands on traditional humanities research approaches. From an InfoVis perspective, we lack case studies that show the specific design challenges that make literary studies and humanities research at large a unique application area for information visualization. We examine these questions through our case study of the Speculative W@nderverse, a visualization tool that was designed to enable the analysis and exploration of an untapped literary collection consisting of thousands of science fiction short stories. We present the results of two empirical studies that involved general-interest readers and literary scholars who used the evolving visualization prototype as part of their research for over a year. Our findings suggest a design space for visualizing literary collections that is defined by (1) their academic and public relevance, (2) the tension between qualitative vs. quantitative methods of interpretation, (3) result-vs. process-driven approaches to InfoVis, and (4) the unique material and visual qualities of cultural collections. Through the Speculative W@nderverse we demonstrate how visualization can bridge these sometimes contradictory perspectives by cultivating curiosity and providing entry points into literary collections while, at the same time, supporting multiple aspects of humanities research processes.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467452
Animation and Motion,InfoVis,2015,Visual Mementos: Reflecting Memories with Personal Data,"In this paper we discuss the creation of visual mementos as a new application area for visualization. We define visual mementos as visualizations of personally relevant data for the purpose of reminiscing, and sharing of life experiences. Today more people collect digital information about their life than ever before. The shift from physical to digital archives poses new challenges and opportunities for self- reflection and self-representation. Drawing on research on autobiographical memory and on the role of artifacts in reminiscing, we identified design challenges for visual mementos: mapping data to evoke familiarity, expressing subjectivity, and obscuring sensitive details for sharing. Visual mementos can make use of the known strengths of visualization in revealing patterns to show the familiar instead of the unexpected, and extend representational mappings beyond the objective to include the more subjective. To understand whether people's subjective views on their past can be reflected in a visual representation, we developed, deployed and studied a technology probe that exemplifies our concept of visual mementos. Our results show how reminiscing has been supported and reveal promising new directions for self-reflection and sharing through visual mementos of personal experiences.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467831
Animation and Motion,SciVis,2015,A visual voting framework for weather forecast calibration - IEEE Conference Publication,"Numerical weather predictions have been widely used for weather forecasting. Many large meteorological centers are producing highly accurate ensemble forecasts routinely to provide effective weather forecast services. However, biases frequently exist in forecast products because of various reasons, such as the imperfection of the weather forecast models. Failure to identify and neutralize the biases would result in unreliable forecast products that might mislead analysts; consequently, unreliable weather predictions are produced. The analog method has been commonly used to overcome the biases. Nevertheless, this method has some serious limitations including the difficulties in finding effective similar past forecasts, the large search space for proper parameters and the lack of support for interactive, real-time analysis. In this study, we develop a visual analytics system based on a novel voting framework to circumvent the problems. The framework adopts the idea of majority voting to combine judiciously the different variants of analog methods towards effective retrieval of the proper analogs for calibration. The system seamlessly integrates the analog methods into an interactive visualization pipeline with a set of coordinated views that characterizes the different methods. Instant visual hints are provided in the views to guide users in finding and refining analogs. We have worked closely with the domain experts in the meteorological research to develop the system. The effectiveness of the system is demonstrated using two case studies. An informal evaluation with the experts proves the usability and usefulness of the system.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/SciVis.2015.7429488
Animation and Motion,SciVis,2015,TelCoVis: Visual Exploration of Co-occurrence in Urban Human Mobility Based on Telco Data,"Understanding co-occurrence in urban human mobility (i.e. people from two regions visit an urban place during the same time span) is of great value in a variety of applications, such as urban planning, business intelligence, social behavior analysis, as well as containing contagious diseases. In recent years, the widespread use of mobile phones brings an unprecedented opportunity to capture large-scale and fine- grained data to study co-occurrence in human mobility. However, due to the lack of systematic and efficient methods, it is challenging for analysts to carry out in-depth analyses and extract valuable information. In this paper, we present TelCoVis, an interactive visual analytics system, which helps analysts leverage their domain knowledge to gain insight into the co- occurrence in urban human mobility based on telco data. Our system integrates visualization techniques with new designs and combines them in a novel way to enhance analysts' perception for a comprehensive exploration. In addition, we propose to study the correlations in co-occurrence (i.e. people from multiple regions visit different places during the same time span) by means of biclustering techniques that allow analysts to better explore coordinated relationships among different regions and identify interesting patterns. The case studies based on a real-world dataset and interviews with domain experts have demonstrated the effectiveness of our system in gaining insights into co- occurrence and facilitating various analytical tasks.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467194
Animation and Motion,VAST,2015,TimeLineCurator: Interactive Authoring of Visual Timelines from Unstructured Text,"We present TimeLineCurator, a browser-based authoring tool that automatically extracts event data from temporal references in unstructured text documents using natural language processing and encodes them along a visual timeline. Our goal is to facilitate the timeline creation process for journalists and others who tell temporal stories online. Current solutions involve manually extracting and formatting event data from source documents, a process that tends to be tedious and error prone. With TimeLineCurator, a prospective timeline author can quickly identify the extent of time encompassed by a document, as well as the distribution of events occurring along this timeline. Authors can speculatively browse possible documents to quickly determine whether they are appropriate sources of timeline material. TimeLineCurator provides controls for curating and editing events on a timeline, the ability to combine timelines from multiple source documents, and export curated timelines for online deployment. We evaluate TimeLineCurator through a benchmark comparison of entity extraction error against a manual timeline curation process, a preliminary evaluation of the user experience of timeline authoring, a brief qualitative analysis of its visual output, and a discussion of prospective use cases suggested by members of the target author communities following its deployment.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467531
Animation and Motion,VAST,2015,MotionFlow: Visual Abstraction and Aggregation of Sequential Patterns in Human Motion Tracking Data,"Pattern analysis of human motions, which is useful in many research areas, requires understanding and comparison of different styles of motion patterns. However, working with human motion tracking data to support such analysis poses great challenges. In this paper, we propose MotionFlow, a visual analytics system that provides an effective overview of various motion patterns based on an interactive flow visualization. This visualization formulates a motion sequence as transitions between static poses, and aggregates these sequences into a tree diagram to construct a set of motion patterns. The system also allows the users to directly reflect the context of data and their perception of pose similarities in generating representative pose states. We provide local and global controls over the partition-based clustering process. To support the users in organizing unstructured motion data into pattern groups, we designed a set of interactions that enables searching for similar motion sequences from the data, detailed exploration of data subsets, and creating and modifying the group of motion patterns. To evaluate the usability of MotionFlow, we conducted a user study with six researchers with expertise in gesture-based interaction design. They used MotionFlow to explore and organize unstructured motion tracking data. Results show that the researchers were able to easily learn how to use MotionFlow, and the system effectively supported their pattern analysis activities, including leveraging their perception and domain knowledge.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2468292
Animation and Motion,VAST,2015,Mixed-initiative visual analytics using task-driven recommendations - IEEE Conference Publication,"Visual data analysis is composed of a collection of cognitive actions and tasks to decompose, internalize, and recombine data to produce knowledge and insight. Visual analytic tools provide interactive visual interfaces to data to support discovery and sensemaking tasks, including forming hypotheses, asking questions, and evaluating and organizing evidence. Myriad analytic models can be incorporated into visual analytic systems at the cost of increasing complexity in the analytic discourse between user and system. Techniques exist to increase the usability of interacting with analytic models, such as inferring data models from user interactions to steer the underlying models of the system via semantic interaction, shielding users from having to do so explicitly. Such approaches are often also referred to as mixed-initiative systems. Sensemaking researchers have called for development of tools that facilitate analytic sensemaking through a combination of human and automated activities. However, design guidelines do not exist for mixed-initiative visual analytic systems to support iterative sensemaking. In this paper, we present candidate design guidelines and introduce the Active Data Environment (ADE) prototype, a spatial workspace supporting the analytic process via task recommendations invoked by inferences about user interactions within the workspace. ADE recommends data and relationships based on a task model, enabling users to co-reason with the system about their data in a single, spatial workspace. This paper provides an illustrative use case, a technical description of ADE, and a discussion of the strengths and limitations of the approach.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2015.7347625
Animation and Motion,InfoVis,2014,"Overview: The Design, Adoption, and Analysis of a Visual Document Mining Tool for Investigative Journalists","For an investigative journalist, a large collection of documents obtained from a Freedom of Information Act request or a leak is both a blessing and a curse: such material may contain multiple newsworthy stories, but it can be difficult and time consuming to find relevant documents. Standard text search is useful, but even if the search target is known it may not be possible to formulate an effective query. In addition, summarization is an important non-search task. We present Overview, an application for the systematic analysis of large document collections based on document clustering, visualization, and tagging. This work contributes to the small set of design studies which evaluate a visualization system ""in the wild"", and we report on six case studies where Overview was voluntarily used by self-initiated journalists to produce published stories. We find that the frequently-used language of ""exploring"" a document collection is both too vague and too narrow to capture how journalists actually used our application. Our iterative process, including multiple rounds of deployment and observations of real world usage, led to a much more specific characterization of tasks. We analyze and justify the visual encoding and interaction techniques used in Overview's design with respect to our final task abstractions, and propose generalizable lessons for visualization design methodology.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346431
Animation and Motion,InfoVis,2014,Moving beyond sequential design: Reflections on a rich multi-channel approach to data visualization,"We reflect on a four-year engagement with transport authorities and others involving a large dataset describing the use of a public bicycle-sharing scheme. We describe the role visualization of these data played in fostering engagement with policy makers, transport operators, the transport research community, the museum and gallery sector and the general public. We identify each of these as `channels'-evolving relationships between producers and consumers of visualization-where traditional roles of the visualization expert and domain expert are blurred. In each case, we identify the different design decisions that were required to support each of these channels and the role played by the visualization process. Using chauffeured interaction with a flexible visual analytics system we demonstrate how insight was gained by policy makers into gendered spatio-temporal cycle behaviors, how this led to further insight into workplace commuting activity, group cycling behavior and explanations for street navigation choice. We demonstrate how this supported, and was supported by, the seemingly unrelated development of narrative-driven visualization via TEDx, of the creation and the setting of an art installation and the curating of digital and physical artefacts. We assert that existing models of visualization design, of tool/technique development and of insight generation do not adequately capture the richness of parallel engagement via these multiple channels of communication. We argue that developing multiple channels in parallel opens up opportunities for visualization design and analysis by building trust and authority and supporting creativity. This rich, non-sequential approach to visualization design is likely to foster serendipity, deepen insight and increase impact.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346323
Animation and Motion,SciVis,2014,Using Topological Analysis to Support Event-Guided Exploration in Urban Data,"The explosion in the volume of data about urban environments has opened up opportunities to inform both policy and administration and thereby help governments improve the lives of their citizens, increase the efficiency of public services, and reduce the environmental harms of development. However, cities are complex systems and exploring the data they generate is challenging. The interaction between the various components in a city creates complex dynamics where interesting facts occur at multiple scales, requiring users to inspect a large number of data slices over time and space. Manual exploration of these slices is ineffective, time consuming, and in many cases impractical. In this paper, we propose a technique that supports event-guided exploration of large, spatio-temporal urban data. We model the data as time-varying scalar functions and use computational topology to automatically identify events in different data slices. To handle a potentially large number of events, we develop an algorithm to group and index them, thus allowing users to interactively explore and query event patterns on the fly. A visual exploration interface helps guide users towards data slices that display interesting events and trends. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique on two different data sets from New York City (NYC): data about taxi trips and subway service. We also report on the feedback we received from analysts at different NYC agencies.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346449
Animation and Motion,VAST,2014,PEARL: An interactive visual analytic tool for understanding personal emotion style derived from social media - IEEE Conference Publication,"Hundreds of millions of people leave digital footprints on social media (e.g., Twitter and Facebook). Such data not only disclose a person's demographics and opinions, but also reveal one's emotional style. Emotional style captures a person's patterns of emotions over time, including his overall emotional volatility and resilience. Understanding one's emotional style can provide great benefits for both individuals and businesses alike, including the support of self-reflection and delivery of individualized customer care. We present PEARL, a timeline-based visual analytic tool that allows users to interactively discover and examine a person's emotional style derived from this person's social media text. Compared to other visual text analytic systems, our work offers three unique contributions. First, it supports multi-dimensional emotion analysis from social media text to automatically detect a person's expressed emotions at different time points and summarize those emotions to reveal the person's emotional style. Second, it effectively visualizes complex, multi-dimensional emotion analysis results to create a visual emotional profile of an individual, which helps users browse and interpret one's emotional style. Third, it supports rich visual interactions that allow users to interactively explore and validate emotion analysis results. We have evaluated our work extensively through a series of studies. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our tool both in emotion analysis from social media and in support of interactive visualization of the emotion analysis results.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2014.7042496

With the advent of new technologies that allow all players and the ball to be tracked across the entire field, it is now possible to bring this understanding to another level. From discrete positions across time, we present techniques to reconstruct entire baseball games and visually explore each play. This provides opportunities to not only derive new metrics for the game, but also allow us to investigate existing measures with targeted visualizations. In addition, our techniques allow users to filter on demand so specific situations can be analyzed both in general and according to those situations. We show that gameplay can be accurately reconstructed from the raw position data and discuss how visualization and statistical methods can combine to better inform baseball analyses.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2014.7042478
Animation and Motion,VAST,2014,Proactive Spatiotemporal Resource Allocation and Predictive Visual Analytics for Community Policing and Law Enforcement,"In this paper, we present a visual analytics approach that provides decision makers with a proactive and predictive environment in order to assist them in making effective resource allocation and deployment decisions. The challenges involved with such predictive analytics processes include end-users' understanding, and the application of the underlying statistical algorithms at the right spatiotemporal granularity levels so that good prediction estimates can be established. In our approach, we provide analysts with a suite of natural scale templates and methods that enable them to focus and drill down to appropriate geospatial and temporal resolution levels. Our forecasting technique is based on the Seasonal Trend decomposition based on Loess (STL) method, which we apply in a spatiotemporal visual analytics context to provide analysts with predicted levels of future activity. We also present a novel kernel density estimation technique we have developed, in which the prediction process is influenced by the spatial correlation of recent incidents at nearby locations.

Each component encapsulates a high-fidelity simulation model that together form an asynchronous simulation pipeline: a system of systems of individual simulations with a common data and parameter exchange format. At the heart of VASA is the Workbench, a visual analytics application providing three distinct features: (1) low-fidelity approximations of the distributed simulation components using local simulation proxies to enable analysts to interactively configure a simulation run; (2) computational steering mechanisms to manage the execution of individual simulation components; and (3) spatiotemporal and interactive methods to explore the combined results of a simulation run.

Analysis of these issues can improve living quality through evidence-based decision making. However, these issues are complex, because of the involvement of spatial and temporal components, in addition to having multi-dimensional and multivariate natures. Consequently, exploring utility service problems and creating visual representations are difficult. To analyze these issues, we propose a visual analytics process based on the main tasks of utility service management.

Animation and Motion,VAST,2014,Footprints: A Visual Search Tool that Supports Discovery and Coverage Tracking,"Searching a large document collection to learn about a broad subject involves the iterative process of figuring out what to ask, filtering the results, identifying useful documents, and deciding when one has covered enough material to stop searching. We are calling this activity ""discoverage,"" discovery of relevant material and tracking coverage of that material. We built a visual analytic tool called Footprints that uses multiple coordinated visualizations to help users navigate through the discoverage process. To support discovery, Footprints displays topics extracted from documents that provide an overview of the search space and are used to construct searches visuospatially. Footprints allows users to triage their search results by assigning a status to each document (To Read, Read, Useful), and those status markings are shown on interactive histograms depicting the user's coverage through the documents across dates, sources, and topics. Coverage histograms help users notice biases in their search and fill any gaps in their analytic process. To create Footprints, we used a highly iterative, user-centered approach in which we conducted many evaluations during both the design and implementation stages and continually modified the design in response to feedback.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346743

The process gives rise to novel designs and design metaphors including data sculpting. It suggests: that the deliberate use of creativity techniques with data stakeholders is likely to contribute to successful, novel and effective solutions; that being explicit about creativity may contribute to designers developing creative solutions; that using creativity techniques early in the design process may result in a creative approach persisting throughout the process. The work constitutes the first systematic visualization design for a data rich source that will be increasingly important to energy suppliers and consumers as Smart Meter technology is widely deployed.

In this paper, we focus on a particularly important urban data set: taxi trips. Taxis are valuable sensors and information associated with taxi trips can provide unprecedented insight into many different aspects of city life, from economic activity and human behavior to mobility patterns. But analyzing these data presents many challenges. The data are complex, containing geographical and temporal components in addition to multiple variables associated with each trip. Consequently, it is hard to specify exploratory queries and to perform comparative analyses (e.g., compare different regions over time). This problem is compounded due to the size of the data-there are on average 500,000 taxi trips each day in NYC. We propose a new model that allows users to visually query taxi trips. Besides standard analytics queries, the model supports origin-destination queries that enable the study of mobility across the city. We show that this model is able to express a wide range of spatio-temporal queries, and it is also flexible in that not only can queries be composed but also different aggregations and visual representations can be applied, allowing users to explore and compare results. We have built a scalable system that implements this model which supports interactive response times; makes use of an adaptive level-of-detail rendering strategy to generate clutter-free visualization for large results; and shows hidden details to the users in a summary through the use of overlay heat maps. We present a series of case studies motivated by traffic engineers and economists that show how our model and system enable domain experts to perform tasks that were previously unattainable for them.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2013.226

Several case studies have been carried out using real-world wall painting data collected from a renowned World Heritage site, to verify the usability and effectiveness of the proposed method.

Our optimal transport map approach is rigorous and solid in theory, efficient and parallel in computation, yet general for various applications. By comparison with the conventional Monge-Kantorovich approach, our method reduces the number of variables from O(n2) to O(n), and converts the optimal mass transport problem to a convex optimization problem, which can now be efficiently carried out by Newton's method. Furthermore, our framework includes the area weighting strategy that enables users to completely control and adjust the size of areas everywhere in an accurate and quantitative way. Our method significantly reduces the complexity of the problem, and improves the efficiency, flexibility and scalability during visualization. Our framework, by combining conformal mapping and optimal mass transport mapping, serves as a powerful tool for a broad range of applications in visualization and graphics, especially for medical imaging.

In a study with 117 participants, we compared the benefit of static vs. dynamic visualization training tools on learners with different spatial abilities performing a typical 3-D task (specifically, creating orthographic projections of a 3-D object). We measured the spatial abilities of the participants using the Mental Rotation Test (MRT) and classified participants into two groups (high and low abilities) to examine how the participants' abilities predicted change in performance after training with static versus dynamic training tools. Our results indicate that: 1) visualization training programs can help learners to improve 3-D task performance, 2) dynamic visualizations provide no advantages over static visualizations that show intermediate steps, 3) training programs are more beneficial for individuals with low spatial abilities than for individuals with high spatial abilities, and 4) training individuals with high spatial abilities using dynamic visualizations provides little benefit.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2013.156

The manual extraction and evaluation is tedious and requires expert knowledge. Standardized, (semi-)automatic and reliable techniques are necessary to make the analysis of 4D PC-MRI applicable for the clinical routine. In this work, we present an approach for the extraction of vortex flow in the aorta and pulmonary artery incorporating line predicates. We provide an extensive comparison of existent vortex extraction methods to determine the most suitable vortex criterion for cardiac blood flow and apply our approach to ten datasets with different pathologies like coarctations, Tetralogy of Fallot and aneurysms. For two cases we provide a detailed discussion how our results are capable to complement existent diagnosis information. To ensure real-time feedback for the domain experts we implement our method completely on the GPU.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2013.189
Animation and Motion,Vis,2013,GRACE: A Visual Comparison Framework for Integrated Spatial and Non-Spatial Geriatric Data,"We present the design of a novel framework for the visual integration, comparison, and exploration of correlations in spatial and non- spatial geriatric research data. These data are in general high-dimensional and span both the spatial, volumetric domain - through magnetic resonance imaging volumes - and the non-spatial domain, through variables such as age, gender, or walking speed. The visual analysis framework blends medical imaging, mathematical analysis and interactive visualization techniques, and includes the adaptation of Sparse Partial Least Squares and iterated Tikhonov Regularization algorithms to quantify potential neurologymobility connections. A linked-view design geared specifically at interactive visual comparison integrates spatial and abstract visual representations to enable the users to effectively generate and refine hypotheses in a large, multidimensional, and fragmented space. In addition to the domain analysis and design description, we demonstrate the usefulness of this approach on two case studies. Last, we report the lessons learned through the iterative design and evaluation of our approach, in particular those relevant to the design of comparative visualization of spatial and non-spatial data.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2013.161
Animation and Motion,Vis,2013,ManyVis: Multiple Applications in an Integrated Visualization Environment,"As the visualization field matures, an increasing number of general toolkits are developed to cover a broad range of applications. However, no general tool can incorporate the latest capabilities for all possible applications, nor can the user interfaces and workflows be easily adjusted to accommodate all user communities. As a result, users will often chose either substandard solutions presented in familiar, customized tools or assemble a patchwork of individual applications glued through ad-hoc scripts and extensive, manual intervention. Instead, we need the ability to easily and rapidly assemble the best-in-task tools into custom interfaces and workflows to optimally serve any given application community. Unfortunately, creating such meta-applications at the API or SDK level is difficult, time consuming, and often infeasible due to the sheer variety of data models, design philosophies, limits in functionality, and the use of closed commercial systems. In this paper, we present the ManyVis framework which enables custom solutions to be built both rapidly and simply by allowing coordination and communication across existing unrelated applications. ManyVis allows users to combine software tools with complementary characteristics into one virtual application driven by a single, custom-designed interface.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2013.174
Animation and Motion,InfoVis,2012,Living Liquid: Design and Evaluation of an Exploratory Visualization Tool for Museum Visitors,"Interactive visualizations can allow science museum visitors to explore new worlds by seeing and interacting with scientific data. However, designing interactive visualizations for informal learning environments, such as museums, presents several challenges. First, visualizations must engage visitors on a personal level. Second, visitors often lack the background to interpret visualizations of scientific data. Third, visitors have very limited time at individual exhibits in museums. This paper examines these design considerations through the iterative development and evaluation of an interactive exhibit as a visualization tool that gives museumgoers access to scientific data generated and used by researchers. The exhibit prototype, Living Liquid, encourages visitors to ask and answer their own questions while exploring the time- varying global distribution of simulated marine microbes using a touchscreen interface. Iterative development proceeded through three rounds of formative evaluations using think-aloud protocols and interviews, each round informing a key visualization design decision: (1) what to visualize to initiate inquiry, (2) how to link data at the microscopic scale to global patterns, and (3) how to include additional data that allows visitors to pursue their own questions. Data from visitor evaluations suggests that, when designing visualizations for public audiences, one should (1) avoid distracting visitors from data that they should explore, (2) incorporate background information into the visualization, (3) favor understandability over scientific accuracy, and (4) layer data accessibility to structure inquiry. Lessons learned from this case study add to our growing understanding of how to use visualizations to actively engage learners with scientific data.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2012.244
Animation and Motion,Vis,2012,Interactive Volume Exploration of Petascale Microscopy Data Streams Using a Visualization-Driven Virtual Memory Approach,"This paper presents the first volume visualization system that scales to petascale volumes imaged as a continuous stream of high-resolution electron microscopy images. Our architecture scales to dense, anisotropic petascale volumes because it: (1) decouples construction of the 3D multi-resolution representation required for visualization from data acquisition, and (2) decouples sample access time during ray-casting from the size of the multi-resolution hierarchy. Our system is designed around a scalable multi-resolution virtual memory architecture that handles missing data naturally, does not pre-compute any 3D multi-resolution representation such as an octree, and can accept a constant stream of 2D image tiles from the microscopes. A novelty of our system design is that it is visualization- driven: we restrict most computations to the visible volume data. Leveraging the virtual memory architecture, missing data are detected during volume ray- casting as cache misses, which are propagated backwards for on-demand out-of- core processing. 3D blocks of volume data are only constructed from 2D microscope image tiles when they have actually been accessed during ray- casting. We extensively evaluate our system design choices with respect to scalability and performance, compare to previous best-of-breed systems, and illustrate the effectiveness of our system for real microscopy data from neuroscience.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2012.240
Animation and Motion,Vis,2012,Automatic Detection and Visualization of Qualitative Hemodynamic Characteristics in Cerebral Aneurysms,"Cerebral aneurysms are a pathological vessel dilatation that bear a high risk of rupture. For the understanding and evaluation of the risk of rupture, the analysis of hemodynamic information plays an important role. Besides quantitative hemodynamic information, also qualitative flow characteristics, e.g., the inflow jet and impingement zone are correlated with the risk of rupture. However, the assessment of these two characteristics is currently based on an interactive visual investigation of the flow field, obtained by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) or blood flow measurements. We present an automatic and robust detection as well as an expressive visualization of these characteristics. The detection can be used to support a comparison, e.g., of simulation results reflecting different treatment options. Our approach utilizes local streamline properties to formalize the inflow jet and impingement zone. We extract a characteristic seeding curve on the ostium, on which an inflow jet boundary contour is constructed. Based on this boundary contour we identify the impingement zone. Furthermore, we present several visualization techniques to depict both characteristics expressively. Thereby, we consider accuracy and robustness of the extracted characteristics, minimal visual clutter and occlusions. An evaluation with six domain experts confirms that our approach detects both hemodynamic characteristics reasonably.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2012.202
Animation and Motion,InfoVis,2011,BallotMaps: Detecting Name Bias in Alphabetically Ordered Ballot Papers,"The relationship between candidates' position on a ballot paper and vote rank is explored in the case of 5000 candidates for the UK 2010 local government elections in the Greater London area. This design study uses hierarchical spatially arranged graphics to represent two locations that affect candidates at very different scales: the geographical areas for which they seek election and the spatial location of their names on the ballot paper. This approach allows the effect of position bias to be assessed; that is, the degree to which the position of a candidate's name on the ballot paper influences the number of votes received by the candidate, and whether this varies geographically. Results show that position bias was significant enough to influence rank order of candidates, and in the case of many marginal electoral wards, to influence who was elected to government. Position bias was observed most strongly for Liberal Democrat candidates but present for all major political parties. Visual analysis of classification of candidate names by ethnicity suggests that this too had an effect on votes received by candidates, in some cases overcoming alphabetic name bias. The results found contradict some earlier research suggesting that alphabetic name bias was not sufficiently significant to affect electoral outcome and add new evidence for the geographic and ethnicity influences on voting behaviour. The visual approach proposed here can be applied to a wider range of electoral data and the patterns identified and hypotheses derived from them could have significant implications for the design of ballot papers and the conduct of fair elections.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2011.174
Animation and Motion,Vis,2011,Nodes on Ropes: A Comprehensive Data and Control Flow for Steering Ensemble Simulations,"Flood disasters are the most common natural risk and tremendous efforts are spent to improve their simulation and management. However, simulation-based investigation of actions that can be taken in case of flood emergencies is rarely done. This is in part due to the lack of a comprehensive framework which integrates and facilitates these efforts. In this paper, we tackle several problems which are related to steering a flood simulation. One issue is related to uncertainty. We need to account for uncertain knowledge about the environment, such as levee-breach locations. Furthermore, the steering process has to reveal how these uncertainties in the boundary conditions affect the confidence in the simulation outcome. Another important problem is that the simulation setup is often hidden in a black-box. We expose system internals and show that simulation steering can be comprehensible at the same time. This is important because the domain expert needs to be able to modify the simulation setup in order to include local knowledge and experience. In the proposed solution, users steer parameter studies through the World Lines interface to account for input uncertainties. The transport of steering information to the underlying data-flow components is handled by a novel meta-flow. The meta-flow is an extension to a standard data-flow network, comprising additional nodes and ropes to abstract parameter control. The meta-flow has a visual representation to inform the user about which control operations happen. Finally, we present the idea to use the data-flow diagram itself for visualizing steering information and simulation results. We discuss a case-study in collaboration with a domain expert who proposes different actions to protect a virtual city from imminent flooding. The key to choosing the best response strategy is the ability to compare different regions of the parameter space while retaining an understanding of what is happening inside the data-flow system.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2011.225
Animation and Motion,InfoVis,2010,Narrative Visualization: Telling Stories with Data,"Data visualization is regularly promoted for its ability to reveal stories within data, yet these ""data stories"" differ in important ways from traditional forms of storytelling. Storytellers, especially online journalists, have increasingly been integrating visualizations into their narratives, in some cases allowing the visualization to function in place of a written story. In this paper, we systematically review the design space of this emerging class of visualizations. Drawing on case studies from news media to visualization research, we identify distinct genres of narrative visualization. We characterize these design differences, together with interactivity and messaging, in terms of the balance between the narrative flow intended by the author (imposed by graphical elements and the interface) and story discovery on the part of the reader (often through interactive exploration). Our framework suggests design strategies for narrative visualization, including promising under-explored approaches to journalistic storytelling and educational media.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2010.179

We defined email behavior as the email activity level of people regarding a series of measured metrics e.g. sent and received emails, numbers of email addresses, etc. These metrics were calculated through EmailTime, a visual analysis tool of email correspondence over the course of time. Results showed specific patterns in the email datasets of different organizational positions.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2010.5649905

This paper presents EmailTime's capabilities through several examples. EmailTime is a visual analysis of email correspondence patterns over the course of time that interactively portrays personal and interpersonal networks using the correspondence in the email dataset. We suggest that integrating both statistics and visualizations in order to display information about the email datasets may simplify its evaluation.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2010.5652968
Animation and Motion,VAST,2010,ALIDA: Using machine learning for intent discernment in visual analytics interfaces - IEEE Conference Publication,"In this paper, we introduce ALIDA, an Active Learning Intent Discerning Agent for visual analytics interfaces. As users interact with and explore data in a visual analytics environment they are each developing their own unique analytic process. The goal of ALIDA is to observe and record the human-computer interactions and utilize these observations as a means of supporting user exploration; ALIDA does this by using interaction to make decision about user interest. As such, ALIDA is designed to track the decision history (interactions) of a user. This history is then utilized to enhance the user's decision-making process by allowing the user to return to previously visited search states, as well as providing suggestions of other search states that may be of interest based on past exploration modalities. The agent passes these suggestions (or decisions) back to an interactive visualization prototype, and these suggestions are used to guide the user, either by suggesting searches or changes to the visualization view. Current work has tested ALIDA under the exploration of homonyms for users wishing to explore word linkages within a dictionary. Ongoing work includes using ALIDA to guide users in transfer function design for volume rendering within scientific gateways.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2010.5650854
Animation and Motion,VAST,2010,Diamonds in the rough: Social media visual analytics for journalistic inquiry - IEEE Conference Publication,"Journalists increasingly turn to social media sources such as Facebook or Twitter to support their coverage of various news events. For large-scale events such as televised debates and speeches, the amount of content on social media can easily become overwhelming, yet still contain information that may aid and augment reporting via individual content items as well as via aggregate information from the crowd's response. In this work we present a visual analytic tool, Vox Civitas, designed to help journalists and media professionals extract news value from large-scale aggregations of social media content around broadcast events. We discuss the design of the tool, present the text analysis techniques used to enable the presentation, and provide details on the visual and interaction design. We provide an exploratory evaluation based on a user study in which journalists interacted with the system to explore and report on a dataset of over one hundred thousand twitter messages collected during the U.S. State of the Union presidential address in 2010.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2010.5652922
Animation and Motion,Vis,2010,Special Relativistic Visualization by Local Ray Tracing,"Special relativistic visualization offers the possibility of experiencing the optical effects of traveling near the speed of light, including apparent geometric distortions as well as Doppler and searchlight effects. Early high-quality computer graphics images of relativistic scenes were created using offline, computationally expensive CPU-side 4D ray tracing. Alternate approaches such as image-based rendering and polygon-distortion methods are able to achieve interactivity, but exhibit inferior visual quality due to sampling artifacts. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid rendering technique based on polygon distortion and local ray tracing that facilitates interactive high-quality visualization of multiple objects moving at relativistic speeds in arbitrary directions. The method starts by calculating tight image-space footprints for the apparent triangles of the 3D scene objects. The final image is generated using a single image-space ray tracing step incorporating Doppler and searchlight effects. Our implementation uses GPU shader programming and hardware texture filtering to achieve high rendering speed.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2010.196
Animation and Motion,Vis,2010,Result-Driven Exploration of Simulation Parameter Spaces for Visual Effects Design,"Graphics artists commonly employ physically-based simulation for the generation of effects such as smoke, explosions, and similar phenomena. The task of finding the correct parameters for a desired result, however, is difficult and time- consuming as current tools provide little to no guidance. In this paper, we present a new approach for the visual exploration of such parameter spaces. Given a three-dimensional scene description, we utilize sampling and spatio- temporal clustering techniques to generate a concise overview of the achievable variations and their temporal evolution. Our visualization system then allows the user to explore the simulation space in a goal-oriented manner. Animation sequences with a set of desired characteristics can be composed using a novel search-by-example approach and interactive direct volume rendering is employed to provide instant visual feedback.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2010.190
Animation and Motion,Vis,2010,World Lines,"In this paper we present World Lines as a novel interactive visualization that provides complete control over multiple heterogeneous simulation runs. In many application areas, decisions can only be made by exploring alternative scenarios. The goal of the suggested approach is to support users in this decision making process. In this setting, the data domain is extended to a set of alternative worlds where only one outcome will actually happen. World Lines integrate simulation, visualization and computational steering into a single unified system that is capable of dealing with the extended solution space. World Lines represent simulation runs as causally connected tracks that share a common time axis. This setup enables users to interfere and add new information quickly. A World Line is introduced as a visual combination of user events and their effects in order to present a possible future. To quickly find the most attractive outcome, we suggest World Lines as the governing component in a system of multiple linked views and a simulation component. World Lines employ linking and brushing to enable comparative visual analysis of multiple simulations in linked views. Analysis results can be mapped to various visual variables that World Lines provide in order to highlight the most compelling solutions. To demonstrate this technique we present a flooding scenario and show the usefulness of the integrated approach to support informed decision making.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2010.223
Animation and Motion,VAST,2009,Iterative integration of visual insights during patent search and analysis - IEEE Conference Publication,"Patents are an important economic factor in todays globalized markets. Therefore, the analysis of patent information has become an inevitable task for a variety of interest groups. The retrieval of relevant patent information is an integral part of almost every patent analysis scenario. Unfortunately, the complexity of patent material inhibits a straightforward retrieval of all relevant patent documents and leads to iterative, time-consuming approaches in practice. With `PatViz', a new system for interactive analysis of patent information has been developed to leverage iterative query refinement. PatViz supports users in building complex queries visually and in exploring patent result sets interactively. Thereby, the visual query module introduces an abstraction layer that provides uniform access to different retrieval systems and relieves users of the burden to learn different complex query languages. By establishing an integrated environment it allows for interactive reintegration of insights gained from visual result set exploration into the visual query representation. We expect that the approach we have taken is also suitable to improve iterative query refinement in other Visual Analytics systems.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2009.5333564
Animation and Motion,Vis,2009,Interactive Visual Optimization and Analysis for RFID Benchmarking,"Radiofrequency identification (RFID) is a powerful automatic remote identification technique that has wide applications. To facilitate RFID deployment, an RFID benchmarking instrument called aGate has been invented to identify the strengths and weaknesses of different RFID technologies in various environments. However, the data acquired by aGate are usually complex time varying multidimensional 3D volumetric data, which are extremely challenging for engineers to analyze. In this paper, we introduce a set of visualization techniques, namely, parallel coordinate plots, orientation plots, a visual history mechanism, and a 3D spatial viewer, to help RFID engineers analyze benchmark data visually and intuitively. With the techniques, we further introduce two workflow procedures (a visual optimization procedure for finding the optimum reader antenna configuration and a visual analysis procedure for comparing the performance and identifying the flaws of RFID devices) for the RFID benchmarking, with focus on the performance analysis of the aGate system. The usefulness and usability of the system are demonstrated in the user evaluation.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2009.156
Animation and Motion,InfoVis,2008,Viz-A-Vis: Toward Visualizing Video through Computer Vision,"In the established procedural model of information visualization, the first operation is to transform raw data into data tables. The transforms typically include abstractions that aggregate and segment relevant data and are usually defined by a human, user or programmer. The theme of this paper is that for video, data transforms should be supported by low level computer vision. High level reasoning still resides in the human analyst, while part of the low level perception is handled by the computer. To illustrate this approach, we present Viz-A-Vis, an overhead video capture and access system for activity analysis in natural settings over variable periods of time. Overhead video provides rich opportunities for long-term behavioral and occupancy analysis, but it poses considerable challenges. We present initial steps addressing two challenges. First, overhead video generates overwhelmingly large volumes of video impractical to analyze manually. Second, automatic video analysis remains an open problem for computer vision.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2008.185
Animation and Motion,VAST,2008,The Scalable Reasoning System: Lightweight visualization for distributed analytics - IEEE Conference Publication,"A central challenge in visual analytics is the creation of accessible, widely distributable analysis applications that bring the benefits of visual discovery to as broad a user base as possible. Moreover, to support the role of visualization in the knowledge creation process, it is advantageous to allow users to describe the reasoning strategies they employ while interacting with analytic environments. We introduce an application suite called the Scalable Reasoning System (SRS), which provides web-based and mobile interfaces for visual analysis. The service-oriented analytic framework that underlies SRS provides a platform for deploying pervasive visual analytic environments across an enterprise. SRS represents a ""lightweight"" approach to visual analytics whereby thin client analytic applications can be rapidly deployed in a platform-agnostic fashion. Client applications support multiple coordinated views while giving analysts the ability to record evidence, assumptions, hypotheses and other reasoning artifacts.

Animation and Motion,Vis,2008,Visiting the Godel Universe,"Visualization of general relativity illustrates aspects of Einstein's insights into the curved nature of space and time to the expert as well as the layperson. One of the most interesting models which came up with Einstein's theory was developed by Kurt Godel in 1949. The Godel universe is a valid solution of Einstein's field equations, making it a possible physical description of our universe. It offers remarkable features like the existence of an optical horizon beyond which time travel is possible. Although we know that our universe is not a Godel universe, it is interesting to visualize physical aspects of a world model resulting from a theory which is highly confirmed in scientific history. Standard techniques to adopt an egocentric point of view in a relativistic world model have shortcomings with respect to the time needed to render an image as well as difficulties in applying a direct illumination model. In this paper we want to face both issues to reduce the gap between common visualization standards and relativistic visualization. We will introduce two techniques to speed up recalculation of images by means of preprocessing and lookup tables and to increase image quality through a special optimization applicable to the Godel universe. The first technique allows the physicist to understand the different effects of general relativity faster and better by generating images from existing datasets interactively. By using the intrinsic symmetries of Godel's spacetime which are expressed by the Killing vector field, we are able to reduce the necessary calculations to simple cases using the second technique. This even makes it feasible to account for a direct illumination model during the rendering process. Although the presented methods are applied to Godel's universe, they can also be extended to other manifolds, for example light propagation in moving dielectric media. Therefore, other areas of research can benefit from these generic improvements.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2008.177
Animation and Motion,Vis,2008,Interactive Visualization and Analysis of Transitional Flow,"A stand-alone visualization application has been developed by a multi-disciplinary, collaborative team with the sole purpose of creating an interactive exploration environment allowing turbulent flow researchers to experiment and validate hypotheses using visualization. This system has specific optimizations made in data management, caching computations, and visualization allowing for the interactive exploration of datasets on the order of 1TB in size. Using this application, the user (co-author Calo) is able to interactively visualize and analyze all regions of a transitional flow volume, including the laminar, transitional and fully turbulent regions. The underlying goal of the visualizations produced from these transitional flow simulations is to localize turbulent spots in the laminar region of the boundary layer, determine under which conditions they form, and follow their evolution. The initiation of turbulent spots, which ultimately lead to full turbulence, was located via a proposed feature detection condition and verified by experimental results. The conditions under which these turbulent spots form and coalesce are validated and presented.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2008.146
Animation and Motion,InfoVis,2007,AdaptiviTree: Adaptive Tree Visualization for Tournament-Style Brackets,"Online pick'em games, such as the recent NCAA college basketball March Madness tournament, form a large and rapidly growing industry. In these games, players make predictions on a tournament bracket that defines which competitors play each other and how they proceed toward a single champion. Throughout the course of the tournament, players monitor the brackets to track progress and to compare predictions made by multiple players. This is often a complex sense making task. The classic bracket visualization was designed for use on paper and utilizes an incrementally additive system in which the winner of each match-up is rewritten in the next round as the tournament progresses. Unfortunately, this representation requires a significant amount of space and makes it relatively difficult to get a quick overview of the tournament state since competitors take arbitrary paths through the static bracket. In this paper, we present AdaptiviTree, a novel visualization that adaptively deforms the representation of the tree and uses its shape to convey outcome information. AdaptiviTree not only provides a more compact and understandable representation, but also allows overlays that display predictions as well as other statistics. We describe results from a lab study we conducted to explore the efficacy of AdaptiviTree, as well as from a deployment of the system in a recent real-world sports tournament.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2007.70537
Animation and Motion,InfoVis,2007,Interactive Visual Exploration of a Large Spatio-temporal Dataset: Reflections on a Geovisualization Mashup.,"Exploratory visual analysis is useful for the preliminary investigation of large structured, multifaceted spatio-temporal datasets. This process requires the selection and aggregation of records by time, space and attribute, the ability to transform data and the flexibility to apply appropriate visual encodings and interactions. We propose an approach inspired by geographical 'mashups' in which freely-available functionality and data are loosely but flexibly combined using de facto exchange standards. Our case study combines MySQL, PHP and the LandSerf GIS to allow Google Earth to be used for visual synthesis and interaction with encodings described in KML. This approach is applied to the exploration of a log of 1.42 million requests made of a mobile directory service. Novel combinations of interaction and visual encoding are developed including spatial 'tag clouds', 'tag maps', 'data dials' and multi-scale density surfaces. Four aspects of the approach are informally evaluated: the visual encodings employed, their success in the visual exploration of the dataset, the specific tools used and the 'mashup' approach. Preliminary findings will be beneficial to others considering using mashups for visualization. The specific techniques developed may be more widely applied to offer insights into the structure of multifarious spatio- temporal data of the type explored here.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2007.70570
Animation and Motion,Vis,2007,Listener-based Analysis of Surface Importance for Acoustic Metrics,"Acoustic quality in room acoustics is measured by well defined quantities, like definition, which can be derived from simulated impulse response filters or measured values. These take into account the intensity and phase shift of multiple reflections due to a wave front emanating from a sound source. Definition (D50) and clarity (C50) for example correspond to the fraction of the energy received in total to the energy received in the first 50 ms at a certain listener position. Unfortunately, the impulse response measured at a single point does not provide any information about the direction of reflections, and about the reflection surfaces which contribute to this measure. For the visualization of room acoustics, however, this information is very useful since it allows to discover regions with high contribution and provides insight into the influence of all reflecting surfaces to the quality measure. We use the phonon tracing method to calculate the contribution of the reflection surfaces to the impulse response for different listener positions. This data is used to compute importance values for the geometry taking a certain acoustic metric into account. To get a visual insight into the directional aspect, we map the importance to the reflecting surfaces of the geometry. This visualization indicates which parts of the surfaces need to be changed to enhance the chosen acoustic quality measure. We apply our method to the acoustic improvement of a lecture hall by means of enhancing the overall speech comprehensibility (clarity) and evaluate the results using glyphs to visualize the clarity (C50) values at listener positions throughout the room.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2007.70575
Animation and Motion,Vis,2007,Construction of Simplified Boundary Surfaces from Serial-sectioned Metal Micrographs,We present a method for extracting boundary surfaces from segmented cross-section image data. We use a constrained Potts model to interpolate an arbitrary number of region boundaries between segmented images. This produces a segmented volume from which we extract a triangulated boundary surface using well-known marching tetrahedra methods. This surface contains staircase-like artifacts and an abundance of unnecessary triangles. We describe an approach that addresses these problems with a voxel-accurate simplification algorithm that reduces surface complexity by an order of magnitude. Our boundary interpolation and simplification methods are novel contributions to the study of surface extraction from segmented cross-sections. We have applied our method to construct polycrystal grain boundary surfaces from micrographs of a sample of the metal tantalum.,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2007.70543

Visual identification and comparison of patterns of recurring events is an essential feature of such tools. In this paper, we describe a tool for exploring hotel visitation patterns in and around Rebersburg, Pennsylvania from 1898-1900. The tool uses a wrapping spreadsheet technique, called reruns, to display cyclic patterns of geographic events in multiple overlapping natural and artificial calendars. Implemented as an improvise visualization, the tool is in active development through a iterative process of data collection, hypothesis, design, discovery, and evaluation in close collaboration with historical geographers. Several discoveries have inspired ongoing data collection and plans to expand exploration to include historic weather records and railroad schedules.

Animation and Motion,Vis,2006,Fast and Efficient Compression of Floating-Point Data,"Large scale scientific simulation codes typically run on a cluster of CPUs that write/read time steps to/from a single file system. As data sets are constantly growing in size, this increasingly leads to I/O bottlenecks. When the rate at which data is produced exceeds the available I/O bandwidth, the simulation stalls and the CPUs are idle. Data compression can alleviate this problem by using some CPU cycles to reduce the amount of data needed to be transfered. Most compression schemes, however, are designed to operate offline and seek to maximize compression, not throughput. Furthermore, they often require quantizing floating-point values onto a uniform integer grid, which disqualifies their use in applications where exact values must be retained. We propose a simple scheme for lossless, online compression of floating-point data that transparently integrates into the I/O of many applications. A plug-in scheme for data-dependent prediction makes our scheme applicable to a wide variety of data used in visualization, such as unstructured meshes, point sets, images, and voxel grids. We achieve state-of-the-art compression rates and speeds, the latter in part due to an improved entropy coder. We demonstrate that this significantly accelerates I/O throughput in real simulation runs. Unlike previous schemes, our method also adapts well to variable-precision floating- point and integer data",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2006.143

Based on the technical demands of the procedure state-of-the-art volume rendering techniques are applied and refined to enable real-time, full body virtual autopsies involving gigabyte sized data on standard GPUs. The techniques applied include transfer function based data reduction using level-of-detail selection and multi-resolution rendering techniques. The paper also describes a data management component for large, out-of-core data sets and an extension to the GPU-based raycaster for efficient dual TF rendering. Detailed benchmarks of the pipeline are presented using data sets from forensic cases",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2006.146
Animation and Motion,InfoVis,2005,Temporal visualization of planning polygons for efficient partitioning of geo- spatial data - IEEE Conference Publication,"Partitioning of geo-spatial data for efficient allocation of resources such as schools and emergency health care services is driven by a need to provide better and more effective services. Partitioning of spatial data is a complex process that depends on numerous factors such as population, costs incurred in deploying or utilizing resources and target capacity of a resource. Moreover, complex data such as population distributions are dynamic i.e. they may change over time. Simple animation may not effectively show temporal changes in spatial data. We propose the use of three temporal visualization techniques -wedges, rings and time slices - to display the nature of change in temporal data in a single view. Along with maximizing resource utilization and minimizing utilization costs, a partition should also ensure the long term effectiveness of the plan. We use multi-attribute visualization techniques to highlight the strengths and identify the weaknesses of a partition. Comparative visualization techniques allow multiple partitions to be viewed simultaneously. Users can make informed decisions about how to partition geo spatial data by using a combination of our techniques for multi-attribute visualization, temporal visualization and comparative visualization.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/INFVIS.2005.1532149
Animation and Motion,InfoVis,2005,A sky dome visualisation for identification of astronomical orientations - IEEE Conference Publication,"It has long been known that ancient temples were frequently oriented along the cardinal directions or to certain points along the horizon where Sun or Moon rise or set on special days of the year. In the last decades, archaeologists have found evidence of even older building structures buried in the soil, with doorways that also appear to have distinct orientations. This paper presents a novel diagram combining archaeological maps with a folded-apart, flattened view of the whole sky, showing the local horizon and the daily paths of Sun, Moon and brighter stars. By use of this diagram, interesting groupings of astronomical orientation directions, e.g. to certain Sunrise and Sunset points could be identified, which were evidently used to mark certain days of the year. Orientations to a few significant stars very likely indicated the beginning of the agricultural year in the middle neolithic period",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/INFVIS.2005.1532123
Animation and Motion,Vis,2005,Visualizing the tightening of knots - IEEE Conference Publication,"The study of physical models for knots has recently received much interest in the mathematics community. In this paper, we consider the ropelength model, which considers knots tied in an idealized rope. This model is interesting in pure mathematics, and has been applied to the study of a variety of problems in the natural sciences as well. Modeling and visualizing the tightening of knots in this idealized rope poses some interesting challenges in computer graphics. In particular, self-contact in a deformable rope model is a difficult problem which cannot be handled by standard techniques. In this paper, we describe a solution based on reformulating the contact problem and using constrained-gradient techniques from nonlinear optimization. The resulting animations reveal new properties of the tightening flow and provide new insights into the geometric structure of tight knots and links.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2005.1532844

The 3DFM software suite synthesizes the several data sources from the 3DFM into a coherent view and provides control over data collection and specimen manipulation. Herein, we describe the system architecture designed to handle the several feedback loops and data flows present in the microscope and its control system. We describe the visualization techniques used in the 3DFM software suite, where used, and on which types of data. We present feedback from our scientist-users regarding the usefulness of these techniques, and we also present lessons learned from our successive implementations.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2005.1532829
Animation and Motion,Vis,2005,Opening the black box - data driven visualization of neural networks - IEEE Conference Publication,"Artificial neural networks are computer software or hardware models inspired by the structure and behavior of neurons in the human nervous system. As a powerful learning tool, increasingly neural networks have been adopted by many large-scale information processing applications but there is no a set of well defined criteria for choosing a neural network. The user mostly treats a neural network as a black box and cannot explain how learning from input data was done nor how performance can be consistently ensured. We have experimented with several information visualization designs aiming to open the black box to possibly uncover underlying dependencies between the input data and the output data of a neural network. In this paper, we present our designs and show that the visualizations not only help us design more efficient neural networks, but also assist us in the process of using neural networks for problem solving such as performing a classification task.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2005.1532820
Animation and Motion,Vis,2005,Distributed data management for large volume visualization - IEEE Conference Publication,"We propose a distributed data management scheme for large data visualization that emphasizes efficient data sharing and access. To minimize data access time and support users with a variety of local computing capabilities, we introduce an adaptive data selection method based on an \""enhanced time-space partitioning\"" (ETSP) tree that assists with effective visibility culling, as well as multiresolution data selection. By traversing the tree, our data management algorithm can quickly identify the visible regions of data, and, for each region, adaptively choose the lowest resolution satisfying user- specified error tolerances. Only necessary data elements are accessed and sent to the visualization pipeline. To further address the issue of sharing large- scale data among geographically distributed collaborative teams, we have designed an infrastructure for integrating our data management technique with a distributed data storage system provided by logistical networking (LoN). Data sets at different resolutions are generated and uploaded to LoN for wide- area access. We describe a parallel volume rendering system that verifies the effectiveness of our data storage, selection and access scheme.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2005.1532794

Engineers invest a large amount of time and serious effort to optimize the flow through this engine component because of its important role in transferring heat away from the engine block. In this study we examine the design goals that engineers apply in order to construct an ideal-as-possible cooling jacket geometry and use a broad range of visualization tools in order to analyze, explore, and present the results. We systematically employ direct, geometric, and texture-based flow visualization techniques as well as automatic feature extraction and interactive feature-based methodology.

Given the anatomical scan, and the T/sub 2/ map of the cartilage, we combine the information on the shape and the quality of the cartilage in a single image. The Profile Flag is an intuitive 3D glyph for probing and annotating of the underlying data. It comprises a bulletin board pin-like shape with a small flag on top of it. While moving the glyph along the reconstructed surface of an object, the curve data measured along the pin's needle and in its neighborhood are shown on the flag. The application area of the Profile Flag is manifold, enabling the visualization of profile data of dense but in-homogeneous objects. Furthermore, it extracts the essential part of the data without removing or even reducing the context information. By sticking Profile Flags into the investigated structure, one or more significant locations can be annotated by showing the local characteristics of the data at that locations. In this paper we are demonstrating the properties of the tool by visualizing T/sub 2/ maps of knee cartilage.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2005.1532847

The piece captures video and audio from a museum and constructs an impressionistic visualization of the evolving history in the space. Instead of creating a visualization tool for data analysis, we chose to produce a piece that functions as a souvenir of a particular time and place. We describe the design choices we made in creating this installation, the visualization techniques we developed, and the reactions we observed from users and the media. We suggest that the same approach can be applied to a more general set of visualization contexts, ranging from email archives to newsgroups conversations",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/INFVIS.2004.8
Animation and Motion,InfoVis,2004,Time-Varying Data Visualization Using Information Flocking Boids - IEEE Conference Publication,"This research demonstrates how principles of self-organization and behavior simulation can be used to represent dynamic data evolutions by extending the concept of information flocking, originally introduced by Proctor & Winter (1998), to time-varying datasets. A rule-based behavior system continuously controls and updates the dynamic actions of individual, three-dimensional elements that represent the changing data values of reoccurring data objects. As a result, different distinguishable motion types emerge that are driven by local interactions between the spatial elements as well as the evolution of time-varying data values. Notably, this representation technique focuses on the representation of dynamic data alteration characteristics, or how reoccurring data objects change over time, instead of depicting the exact data values themselves. In addition, it demonstrates the potential of motion as a useful information visualization cue. The original information flocking approach is extended to incorporate time-varying datasets, live database querying, continuous data streaming, real-time data similarity evaluation, automatic shape generation and more stable flocking algorithms. Different experiments prove that information flocking is capable of representing short- term events as well as long-term temporal data evolutions of both individual and groups of time-dependent data objects. An historical stock market quote price dataset is used to demonstrate the algorithms and principles of time- varying information flocking",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/INFVIS.2004.65
Animation and Motion,InfoVis,2004,An Evaluation of Microarray Visualization Tools for Biological Insight - IEEE Conference Publication,"High-throughput experiments such as gene expression microarrays in the life sciences result in large datasets. In response, a wide variety of visualization tools have been created to facilitate data analysis. Biologists often face a dilemma in choosing the best tool for their situation. The tool that works best for one biologist may not work well for another due to differences in the type of insight they seek from their data. A primary purpose of a visualization tool is to provide domain- relevant insight into the data. Ideally, any user wants maximum information in the least possible time. In this paper we identify several distinct characteristics of insight that enable us to recognize and quantify it. Based on this, we empirically evaluate five popular microarray visualization tools. Our conclusions can guide biologists in selecting the best tool for their data, and computer scientists in developing and evaluating visualizations",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/INFVIS.2004.5
Animation and Motion,InfoVis,2004,Matrix Zoom: A Visual Interface to Semi-External Graphs - IEEE Conference Publication,"In Web data, telecommunications traffic and in epidemiological studies, dense subgraphs correspond to subsets of subjects (i.e. users, patients) that share a collection of attributes values (i.e. accessed Web pages, email-calling patterns or disease diagnostic profiles). Visual and computational identification of these \""clusters\"" becomes useful when domain experts desire to determine those factors of major influence in the formation of access and communication clusters or in the detection and contention of disease spread. With the current increases in graphic hardware capabilities and RAM sizes, it is more useful to relate graph sizes to the available screen real estate S and the amount of available RAM M, instead of the number of edges or nodes in the graph. We offer a visual interface that is parameterized by M and S and is particularly suited for navigation tasks that require the identification of subgraphs whose edge density is above certain threshold. This is achieved by providing a zoomable matrix view of the underlying data. This view is strongly coupled to a hierarchical view of the essential information elements present in the data domain. We illustrate the applicability of this work to the visual navigation of cancer incidence data and to an aggregated sample of phone call traffic",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/INFVIS.2004.46
Animation and Motion,Vis,2004,Interactive thickness visualization of articular cartilage - IEEE Conference Publication,"This work describes a method to visualize the thickness of curved thin objects. Given the MRI volume data of articular cartilage, medical doctors investigate pathological changes of the thickness. Since the tissue is very thin, it is impossible to reliably map the thickness information by direct volume rendering. Our idea is based on unfolding of such structures preserving their thickness. This allows to perform anisotropic geometrical operations (e.g., scaling the thickness). However, flattening of a curved structure implies a distortion of its surface. The distortion problem is alleviated through a focus-and-context minimization approach. Distortion is smallest close to a focal point which can be interactively selected by the user.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2004.56
Animation and Motion,Vis,2004,Visualizing competitive behaviors in multi-user virtual environments - IEEE Conference Publication,"We present a system for enhancing observation of user interactions in virtual environments. In particular, we focus on analyzing behavior patterns in the popular team-based first-person perspective game Return to Castle Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory. This game belongs to a genre characterized by two moderate- sized teams (usually 6 to 12 players each) competing over a set of objectives. Our system allows spectators to visualize global features such as large-scale behaviors and team strategies, as opposed to the limited, local view that traditional spectating modes provide. We also add overlay visualizations of semantic information related to the action that might be important to a spectator in order to reduce the information overload that plagues traditional overview visualizations. These overlays can visualize information about abstract concepts such as player distribution over time and areas of intense combat activity, and also highlight important features like player paths, fire coverage, etc. This added information allows spectators to identify important game events more easily and reveals large-scale player behaviors that might otherwise be overlooked.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2004.120
Animation and Motion,Vis,2004,Generating realistic images from hydrothermal plume data - IEEE Conference Publication,"Most data used in the study of seafloor hydrothermal plumes consists of sonar (acoustic) scans and sensor readings. Visual data captures only a portion of the sonar data range due to the prohibitive cost and physical infeasibility of taking sufficient lighting and video equipment to such extreme depths. However, visual images are available from research dives and from the recent IMAX movie, volcanoes of the deep sea. In this application paper, we apply existing lighting models with forward scattering and light attenuation to the 3D sonar data in order to mimic the visual images available. These generated images are compared to existing visual images. This can help the geoscientists understand the relationship between these different data modalities and elucidate some of the mechanisms used to capture the data.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2004.34

Animation and Motion,Vis,2002,A case study on automatic camera placement and motion for visualizing historical data - IEEE Conference Publication,"In this paper, we address the problem of automatic camera positioning and automatic camera path generation in the context of historical data visualization. After short description of the given data, we elaborate on the constraints for the positioning of a virtual camera in such a way that not only the projected area is maximized, but also the depth of the displayed scene. This is especially important when displaying terrain models, which do not provide good 3D impression when only the projected area is maximized. Based on this concept, we present a method for computing an optimal camera position for each instant of time. Since the explored data are not static, but change depending on the explored scene time, we also discuss a method for animation generation. In order to avoid sudden changes of the camera position, when the previous method is applied for each frame (point in time), we introduce pseudo-events in time, which expand the bounding box defined by the currently active events of interest. In particular, this technique allows events happening in a future point in time to be taken into account such that when this time becomes current, all events of interest are already within the current viewing frustum of the camera.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2002.1183826

In this paper, a figure for visualizing performance expressions is described. This figure helps people understand the cause and position of the performance expression as it has expressive cues, which coincide with the cognitive meaning of musical performance, and not by using only MIDI parameter values. The differences we hear between performances are clarified by visualized figures.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2002.1183815

As the Rayleigh number Ra is increased the thermal field develops increasingly thin plume-like structures along which heat is convected. These eventually break down and become turbulent.

In addition, we also present a picture-in-picture display mode, enabling the user to interactively view the data, while \""flying with\"" a particular event, tracking its motion in time and space.

Animation and Motion,Vis,2000,Case study: a methodology for plume visualization with application to real- time acquisition and navigation - IEEE Conference Publication,"Applications of visualization techniques that facilitate comparison of simulation and field datasets of seafloor hydrothermal plumes are demonstrated in order to explore and confirm theories of plume behavior. In comparing these datasets, there is no one-to-one correspondence. We show the comparison by performing quantitative capturing of large scale observable features. The comparisons are needed not only to improve the relevance of the simulations to the field observations, but also to enable real time adjustment of shipboard data collection systems. Our approach for comparing simulation and field datasets is to use skeletonization and centerline representation. Features representing plumes are skeletonized. Skeleton points are used to construct a centerline and to quantify plume properties on planes normal to the centerline. These skeleton points are further used to construct an idealized cone representing a plume isosurface. The difference between the plume feature and the cone is identified as protrusions of turbulent eddies. Comparison of the simulation and field data sets through these abstractions illustrates how these abstractions characterize a plume.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2000.885737
Animation and Motion,Vis,2000,Simplification of surface annotations - IEEE Conference Publication,"Geometric models are often annotated to provide additional information during visualization. Maps may be marked with rivers, roads or topographical information, and CAD data models may highlight the underlying mesh structure. While this additional information may be extremely useful, there is a rendering cost associated with it. Texture maps have often been used to convey this information at relatively low cost, but they suffer from blurring and pixelization at high magnification. We present a technique for simplifying surface annotations based on directed, asymmetric tolerance. By maintaining the annotations as geometry, as opposed to textures, we are able to simplify them while still maintaining the overall appearance of the model over a wide range of magnifications. Texture maps may still be used to provide low-resolution surface detail, such as color. We demonstrate a significant gain in rendering performance while retaining the original appearance of objects from many application domains.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2000.885700

We describe a visualization system for the analysis of application behavior on superscalar processors. Our system provides an overview-plus-detail display of the application's execution. A timeline view of pipeline performance data shows the overall utilization of the pipeline. This information is displayed using multiple time scales, enabling the user to drill down from a high-level application overview to a focus region of hundreds of cycles. This region of interest is displayed in detail using an animated cycle-by-cycle view of the execution. This view shows how instructions are reordered and executed and how functional units are being utilized. Additional context views correlate instuctions in this detailed view with the relevant source code for the application.

Portals (doors and windows) are rendered by warping layered depth images (LDIs). In a preprocessing phase, for every portal, a number of pre- rendered images are combined into an LDI. The resulting LDI stores, exactly once, all surfaces visible in at least one of the images used in the construction, so most of the exposure errors are efficiently eliminated. The LDI can be warped in the McMillan occlusion compatible ordering. A substantial increase in performance is obtained by warping in parallel. Our parallelization scheme achieves good load balancing, scales with the number of processors, and preserves the occlusion compatible ordering. A fast, conservative reference-image-space clipping algorithm also reduces the warping effort.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1998.745305

The realization of these concepts results in a 3D-interface that allows users, especially engineers, to evaluate different configurations of a product and gives them direct access to the product structure. By applying various visualization techniques, product components and their attributes, e.g., their price, can be brought together into one visualization. Thus, in contrast to state-of-the-art software, the product structure, three-dimensional, real-sized components, and attribute values can be combined together in 3D-visualizations.

Animation and Motion,Vis,1997,Multiresolution compression and reconstruction - IEEE Conference Publication,"The paper presents a framework for multiresolution compression and geometric reconstruction of arbitrarily dimensioned data designed for distributed applications. Although being restricted to uniform sampled data, the versatile approach enables the handling of a large variety of real world elements. Examples include nonparametric, parametric and implicit lines, surfaces or volumes, all of which are common to large scale data sets. The framework is based on two fundamental steps: compression is carried out by a remote server and generates a bit-stream transmitted over the underlying network. Geometric reconstruction is performed by the local client and renders a piecewise linear approximation of the data. More precisely, the compression scheme consists of a newly developed pipeline starting from an initial B-spline wavelet precoding. The fundamental properties of wavelets allow progressive transmission and interactive control of the compression gain by means of global and local oracles. In particular the authors discuss the problem of oracles in semiorthogonal settings and propose sophisticated oracles to remove unimportant coefficients. In addition, geometric constraints such as boundary lines can be compressed in a lossless manner and are incorporated into the resulting bit-stream. The reconstruction pipeline performs a piecewise adaptive linear approximation of data using a fast and easy to use point removal strategy which works with any subsequent triangulation technique.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1997.663901

Animation and Motion,Vis,1996,Flexible information visualization of multivariate data from biological sequence similarity searches - IEEE Conference Publication,"Information visualization faces challenges presented by the need to represent abstract data and the relationships within the data. Previously, we presented a system for visualizing similarities between a single DNA sequence and a large database of other DNA sequences (E.H. Chi et al., 1995). Similarity algorithms generate similarity information in textual reports that can be hundreds or thousands of pages long. Our original system visualized the most important variables from these reports. However, the biologists we work with found this system so useful they requested visual representations of other variables. We present an enhanced system for interactive exploration of this multivariate data. We identify a larger set of useful variables in the information space. The new system involves more variables, so it focuses on exploring subsets of the data. We present an interactive system allowing mapping of different variables to different axes, incorporating animation using a time axis, and providing tools for viewing subsets of the data. Detail-on-demand is preserved by hyperlinks to the analysis reports. We present three case studies illustrating the use of these techniques.

Applications - General and Other,InfoVis,2015,HOLA: Human-like Orthogonal Network Layout,"Over the last 50 years a wide variety of automatic network layout algorithms have been developed. Some are fast heuristic techniques suitable for networks with hundreds of thousands of nodes while others are multi-stage frameworks for higher-quality layout of smaller networks. However, despite decades of research currently no algorithm produces layout of comparable quality to that of a human. We give a new ""human-centred"" methodology for automatic network layout algorithm design that is intended to overcome this deficiency. User studies are first used to identify the aesthetic criteria algorithms should encode, then an algorithm is developed that is informed by these criteria and finally, a follow-up study evaluates the algorithm output. We have used this new methodology to develop an automatic orthogonal network layout method, HOLA, that achieves measurably better (by user study) layout than the best available orthogonal layout algorithm and which produces layouts of comparable quality to those produced by hand.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467451
Applications - General and Other,SciVis,2015,Visualization-by-Sketching: An Artist's Interface for Creating Multivariate Time-Varying Data Visualizations,"We present Visualization-by-Sketching, a direct- manipulation user interface for designing new data visualizations. The goals are twofold: First, make the process of creating real, animated, data-driven visualizations of complex information more accessible to artists, graphic designers, and other visual experts with traditional, non-technical training. Second, support and enhance the role of human creativity in visualization design, enabling visual experimentation and workflows similar to what is possible with traditional artistic media. The approach is to conceive of visualization design as a combination of processes that are already closely linked with visual creativity: sketching, digital painting, image editing, and reacting to exemplars. Rather than studying and tweaking low-level algorithms and their parameters, designers create new visualizations by painting directly on top of a digital data canvas, sketching data glyphs, and arranging and blending together multiple layers of animated 2D graphics. This requires new algorithms and techniques to interpret painterly user input relative to data ""under"" the canvas, balance artistic freedom with the need to produce accurate data visualizations, and interactively explore large (e.g., terabyte-sized) multivariate datasets. Results demonstrate a variety of multivariate data visualization techniques can be rapidly recreated using the interface. More importantly, results and feedback from artists support the potential for interfaces in this style to attract new, creative users to the challenging task of designing more effective data visualizations and to help these users stay ""in the creative zone"" as they work.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467153
Applications - General and Other,InfoVis,2014,Activity Sculptures: Exploring the Impact of Physical Visualizations on Running Activity,"Data sculptures are a promising type of visualizations in which data is given a physical form. In the past, they have mostly been used for artistic, communicative or educational purposes, and designers of data sculptures argue that in such situations, physical visualizations can be more enriching than pixel-based visualizations. We present the design of Activity Sculptures: data sculptures of running activity. In a three-week field study we investigated the impact of the sculptures on 14 participants' running activity, the personal and social behaviors generated by the sculptures, as well as participants' experiences when receiving these individual physical tokens generated from the specific data of their runs. The physical rewards generated curiosity and personal experimentation but also social dynamics such as discussion on runs or envy/competition. We argue that such passive (or calm) visualizations can complement nudging and other mechanisms of persuasion with a more playful and reflective look at ones' activity.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2014.2352953
Applications - General and Other,VAST,2013,Vis4Heritage: Visual Analytics Approach on Grotto Wall Painting Degradations,"For preserving the grotto wall paintings and protecting these historic cultural icons from the damage and deterioration in nature environment, a visual analytics framework and a set of tools are proposed for the discovery of degradation patterns. In comparison with the traditional analysis methods that used restricted scales, our method provides users with multi-scale analytic support to study the problems on site, cave, wall and particular degradation area scales, through the application of multidimensional visualization techniques. Several case studies have been carried out using real-world wall painting data collected from a renowned World Heritage site, to verify the usability and effectiveness of the proposed method. User studies and expert reviews were also conducted through by domain experts ranging from scientists such as microenvironment researchers, archivists, geologists, chemists, to practitioners such as conservators, restorers and curators.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2013.219
Applications - General and Other,InfoVis,2012,Sketchy Rendering for Information Visualization,"We present and evaluate a framework for constructing sketchy style information visualizations that mimic data graphics drawn by hand. We provide an alternative renderer for the Processing graphics environment that redefines core drawing primitives including line, polygon and ellipse rendering. These primitives allow higher-level graphical features such as bar charts, line charts, treemaps and node-link diagrams to be drawn in a sketchy style with a specified degree of sketchiness. The framework is designed to be easily integrated into existing visualization implementations with minimal programming modification or design effort. We show examples of use for statistical graphics, conveying spatial imprecision and for enhancing aesthetic and narrative qualities of visualization. We evaluate user perception of sketchiness of areal features through a series of stimulus- response tests in order to assess users' ability to place sketchiness on a ratio scale, and to estimate area. Results suggest relative area judgment is compromised by sketchy rendering and that its influence is dependent on the shape being rendered. They show that degree of sketchiness may be judged on an ordinal scale but that its judgement varies strongly between individuals. We evaluate higher-level impacts of sketchiness through user testing of scenarios that encourage user engagement with data visualization and willingness to critique visualization design. Results suggest that where a visualization is clearly sketchy, engagement may be increased and that attitudes to participating in visualization annotation are more positive. The results of our work have implications for effective information visualization design that go beyond the traditional role of sketching as a tool for prototyping or its use for an indication of general uncertainty.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2012.262
Applications - General and Other,InfoVis,2012,Evaluating the Effect of Style in Information Visualization,"This paper reports on a between-subject, comparative online study of three information visualization demonstrators that each displayed the same dataset by way of an identical scatterplot technique, yet were different in style in terms of visual and interactive embellishment. We validated stylistic adherence and integrity through a separate experiment in which a small cohort of participants assigned our three demonstrators to predefined groups of stylistic examples, after which they described the styles with their own words. From the online study, we discovered significant differences in how participants execute specific interaction operations, and the types of insights that followed from them. However, in spite of significant differences in apparent usability, enjoyability and usefulness between the style demonstrators, no variation was found on the self-reported depth, expert-rated depth, confidence or difficulty of the resulting insights. Three different methods of insight analysis have been applied, revealing how style impacts the creation of insights, ranging from higher-level pattern seeking to a more reflective and interpretative engagement with content, which is what underlies the patterns. As this study only forms the first step in determining how the impact of style in information visualization could be best evaluated, we propose several guidelines and tips on how to gather, compare and categorize insights through an online evaluation study, particularly in terms of analyzing the concise, yet wide variety of insights and observations in a trustworthy and reproducable manner.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2012.221
Applications - General and Other,InfoVis,2011,Exploring Ambient and Artistic Visualization for Residential Energy Use Feedback,"Providing effective feedback on resource consumption in the home is a key challenge of environmental conservation efforts. One promising approach for providing feedback about residential energy consumption is the use of ambient and artistic visualizations. Pervasive computing technologies enable the integration of such feedback into the home in the form of distributed point-of-consumption feedback devices to support decision-making in everyday activities. However, introducing these devices into the home requires sensitivity to the domestic context. In this paper we describe three abstract visualizations and suggest four design requirements that this type of device must meet to be effective: pragmatic, aesthetic, ambient, and ecological. We report on the findings from a mixed methods user study that explores the viability of using ambient and artistic feedback in the home based on these requirements. Our findings suggest that this approach is a viable way to provide resource use feedback and that both the aesthetics of the representation and the context of use are important elements that must be considered in this design space.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2011.196
Applications - General and Other,Vis,2011,The Effect of Colour and Transparency on the Perception of Overlaid Grids,"Overlaid reference elements need to be sufficiently visible to effectively relate to the underlying information, but not so obtrusive that they clutter the presentation. We seek to create guidelines for presenting such structures through experimental studies to define boundary conditions for visual intrusiveness. We base our work on the practice of designers, who use transparency to integrate overlaid grids with their underlying imagery. Previous work discovered a useful range of alpha values for black or white grids overlayed on scatterplot images rendered in shades of gray over gray backgrounds of different lightness values. This work compares black grids to blue and red ones on different image types of scatterplots and maps. We expected that the coloured grids over grayscale images would be more visually salient than black ones, resulting in lower alpha values. Instead, we found that there was no significant difference between the boundaries set for red and black grids, but that the boundaries for blue grids were set consistently higher (more opaque). As in our previous study, alpha values are affected by image density rather than image type, and are consistently lower than many default settings. These results have implications for the design of subtle reference structures.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2011.242
Applications - General and Other,InfoVis,2010,behaviorism: a framework for dynamic data visualization,"While a number of information visualization software frameworks exist, creating new visualizations, especially those that involve novel visualization metaphors, interaction techniques, data analysis strategies, and specialized rendering algorithms, is still often a difficult process. To facilitate the creation of novel visualizations we present a new software framework, behaviorism, which provides a wide range of flexibility when working with dynamic information on visual, temporal, and ontological levels, but at the same time providing appropriate abstractions which allow developers to create prototypes quickly which can then easily be turned into robust systems. The core of the framework is a set of three interconnected graphs, each with associated operators: a scene graph for high-performance 3D rendering, a data graph for different layers of semantically-linked heterogeneous data, and a timing graph for sophisticated control of scheduling, interaction, and animation. In particular, the timing graph provides a unified system to add behaviors to both data and visual elements, as well as to the behaviors themselves. To evaluate the framework we look briefly at three different projects all of which required novel visualizations in different domains, and all of which worked with dynamic data in different ways: an interactive ecological simulation, an information art installation, and an information visualization technique.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2010.126
Applications - General and Other,InfoVis,2009,A Comparison of User-Generated and Automatic Graph Layouts,"The research presented in this paper compares user-generated and automatic graph layouts. Following the methods suggested by van Ham et al. (2008), a group of users generated graph layouts using both multi-touch interaction on a tabletop display and mouse interaction on a desktop computer. Users were asked to optimize their layout for aesthetics and analytical tasks with a social network. We discuss characteristics of the user-generated layouts and interaction methods employed by users in this process. We then report on a web-based study to compare these layouts with the output of popular automatic layout algorithms. Our results demonstrate that the best of the user-generated layouts performed as well as or better than the physics-based layout. Orthogonal and circular automatic layouts were found to be considerably less effective than either the physics-based layout or the best of the user- generated layouts. We highlight several attributes of the various layouts that led to high accuracy and improved task completion time, as well as aspects in which traditional automatic layout methods were unsuccessful for our tasks.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2009.109
Applications - General and Other,InfoVis,2008,Stacked Graphs - Geometry & Aesthetics,"In February 2008, the New York Times published an unusual chart of box office revenues for 7500 movies over 21 years. The chart was based on a similar visualization, developed by the first author, that displayed trends in music listening. This paper describes the design decisions and algorithms behind these graphics, and discusses the reaction on the Web. We suggest that this type of complex layered graph is effective for displaying large data sets to a mass audience. We provide a mathematical analysis of how this layered graph relates to traditional stacked graphs and to techniques such as ThemeRiver, showing how each method is optimizing a different ldquoenergy functionrdquo. Finally, we discuss techniques for coloring and ordering the layers of such graphs. Throughout the paper, we emphasize the interplay between considerations of aesthetics and legibility.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2008.166
Applications - General and Other,Vis,2008,Direct Volume Editing,"In this work we present basic methodology for interactive volume editing on GPUs, and we demonstrate the use of these methods to achieve a number of different effects. We present fast techniques to modify the appearance and structure of volumetric scalar fields given on Cartesian grids. Similar to 2D circular brushes as used in surface painting we present 3D spherical brushes for intuitive coloring of particular structures in such fields. This paint metaphor is extended to allow the user to change the data itself, and the use of this functionality for interactive structure isolation, hole filling, and artefact removal is demonstrated. Building on previous work in the field we introduce high-resolution selection volumes, which can be seen as a resolution-based focus+context metaphor. By utilizing such volumes we present a novel approach to interactive volume editing at sub-voxel accuracy. Finally, we introduce a fast technique to paste textures onto iso-surfaces in a 3D scalar field. Since the texture resolution is independent of the volume resolution, this technique allows structure-aligned textures containing appearance properties or textual information to be used for volume augmentation and annotation.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2008.120
Applications - General and Other,InfoVis,2003,Between aesthetics and utility: designing ambient information visualizations - IEEE Conference Publication,"Unlike traditional information visualization, ambient information visualizations reside in the environment of the user rather than on the screen of a desktop computer. Currently, most dynamic information that is displayed in public places consists of text and numbers. We argue that information visualization can be employed to make such dynamic data more useful and appealing. However, visualizations intended for non-desktop spaces will have to both provide valuable information and present an attractive addition to the environment - they must strike a balance between aesthetical appeal and usefulness. To explore this, we designed a real-time visualization of bus departure times and deployed it in a public space, with about 300 potential users. To make the presentation more visually appealing, we took inspiration from a modern abstract artist. The visualization was designed in two passes. First, we did a preliminary version that was presented to and discussed with prospective users. Based on their input, we did a final design. We discuss the lessons learned in designing this and previous ambient information visualizations, including how visual art can be used as a design constraint, and how the choice of information and the placement of the display affect the visualization.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/INFVIS.2003.1249031
Applications - General and Other,InfoVis,2003,Constant density displays using diversity sampling - IEEE Conference Publication,"The Informedia Digital Video Library user interface summarizes query results with a collage of representative keyframes. We present a user study in which keyframe occlusion caused difficulties. To use the screen space most efficiently to display images, both occlusion and wasted whitespace should be minimized. Thus optimal choices will tend toward constant density displays. However, previous constant density algorithms are based on global density, which leads to occlusion and empty space if the density is not uniform. We introduce an algorithm that considers the layout of individual objects and avoids occlusion altogether. Efficiency concerns are important for dynamic summaries of the Informedia Digital Video Library, which has hundreds of thousands of shots. Posting multiple queries that take into account parameters of the visualization as well as the original query reduces the amount of work required. This greedy algorithm is then compared to an optimal one. The approach is also applicable to visualizations containing complex graphical objects other than images, such as text, icons, or trees.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/INFVIS.2003.1249019
Applications - General and Other,Vis,2002,Bounded-distortion piecewise mesh parameterization - IEEE Conference Publication,"Many computer graphics operations, such as texture mapping, 3D painting, remeshing, mesh compression, and digital geometry processing, require finding a low-distortion parameterization for irregular connectivity triangulations of arbitrary genus 2-manifolds. This paper presents a simple and fast method for computing parameterizations with strictly bounded distortion. The new method operates by flattening the mesh onto a region of the 2D plane. To comply with the distortion bound, the mesh is automatically cut and partitioned on-the-fly. The method guarantees avoiding global and local self-intersections, while attempting to minimize the total length of the introduced seams. To our knowledge, this is the first method to compute the mesh partitioning and the parameterization simultaneously and entirely automatically, while providing guaranteed distortion bounds. Our results on a variety of objects demonstrate that the method is fast enough to work with large complex irregular meshes in interactive applications.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2002.1183795
Applications - General and Other,Vis,1998,Visualizing diffusion tensor images of the mouse spinal cord - IEEE Conference Publication,"Within biological systems, water molecules undergo continuous stochastic Brownian motion. The diffusion rate can give clues to the structure of the underlying tissues. In some tissues, the rate is anisotropic. Diffusion-rate images can be calculated from diffusion-weighted MRI. A 2D diffusion tensor image (DTI) and an associated anatomical scalar field define seven values at each spatial location. We present two new methods for visually representing DTIs. The first method displays an array of ellipsoids, where the shape of each ellipsoid represents one tensor value. The ellipsoids are all normalized to approximately the same size so that they can be displayed simultaneously in context. The second method uses concepts from oil painting to represent the seven-valued data with multiple layers of varying brush strokes. Both methods successfully display most or all of the information in DTIs and provide exploratory methods for understanding them. The ellipsoid method has a simpler interpretation and explanation than the painting-motivated method; the painting-motivated method displays more of the information and is easier to read quantatively. We demonstrate the methods on images of the mouse spinal cord. The visualizations show significant differences between spinal cords from mice suffering from experimental allergic encephalomyelitis and spinal cords from wild-type mice. The differences are consistent with differences shown histologically and suggest that our new non-invasive imaging methodology and visualization of the results could have early diagnostic value for neurodegenerative diseases.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1998.745294
Art and Aesthetics in Visualization,SciVis,2015,Rotation Invariant Vortices for Flow Visualization,"We propose a new class of vortex definitions for flows that are induced by rotating mechanical parts, such as stirring devices, helicopters, hydrocyclones, centrifugal pumps, or ventilators. Instead of a Galilean invariance, we enforce a rotation invariance, i.e., the invariance of a vortex under a uniform-speed rotation of the underlying coordinate system around a fixed axis. We provide a general approach to transform a Galilean invariant vortex concept to a rotation invariant one by simply adding a closed form matrix to the Jacobian. In particular, we present rotation invariant versions of the well-known Sujudi- Haimes, Lambda-2, and Q vortex criteria. We apply them to a number of artificial and real rotating flows, showing that for these cases rotation invariant vortices give better results than their Galilean invariant counterparts.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467200
Art and Aesthetics in Visualization,SciVis,2014,Escape Maps,"We present a technique to visualize the streamline-based mapping between the boundary of a simply-connected subregion of arbitrary 3D vector fields. While the streamlines are seeded on one part of the boundary, the remaining part serves as escape border. Hence, the seeding part of the boundary represents a map of streamline behavior, indicating if streamlines reach the escape border or not. Since the resulting maps typically exhibit a very fine and complex structure and are thus not amenable to direct sampling, our approach instead aims at topologically consistent extraction of their boundary. We show that isocline surfaces of the projected vector field provide a robust basis for stream-surface-based extraction of these boundaries. The utility of our technique is demonstrated in the context of transport processes using vector field data from different domains.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346442
Art and Aesthetics in Visualization,Vis,2012,A Novel Approach to Visualizing Dark Matter Simulations,"In the last decades cosmological N-body dark matter simulations have enabled ab initio studies of the formation of structure in the Universe. Gravity amplified small density fluctuations generated shortly after the Big Bang, leading to the formation of galaxies in the cosmic web. These calculations have led to a growing demand for methods to analyze time-dependent particle based simulations. Rendering methods for such N-body simulation data usually employ some kind of splatting approach via point based rendering primitives and approximate the spatial distributions of physical quantities using kernel interpolation techniques, common in SPH (Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics)-codes. This paper proposes three GPU-assisted rendering approaches, based on a new, more accurate method to compute the physical densities of dark matter simulation data. It uses full phase-space information to generate a tetrahedral tessellation of the computational domain, with mesh vertices defined by the simulation's dark matter particle positions. Over time the mesh is deformed by gravitational forces, causing the tetrahedral cells to warp and overlap. The new methods are well suited to visualize the cosmic web. In particular they preserve caustics, regions of high density that emerge, when several streams of dark matter particles share the same location in space, indicating the formation of structures like sheets, filaments and halos. We demonstrate the superior image quality of the new approaches in a comparison with three standard rendering techniques for N-body simulation data.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2012.187
Art and Aesthetics in Visualization,Vis,2012,Visualization of Astronomical Nebulae via Distributed Multi-GPU Compressed Sensing Tomography,"The 3D visualization of astronomical nebulae is a challenging problem since only a single 2D projection is observable from our fixed vantage point on Earth. We attempt to generate plausible and realistic looking volumetric visualizations via a tomographic approach that exploits the spherical or axial symmetry prevalent in some relevant types of nebulae. Different types of symmetry can be implemented by using different randomized distributions of virtual cameras. Our approach is based on an iterative compressed sensing reconstruction algorithm that we extend with support for position-dependent volumetric regularization and linear equality constraints. We present a distributed multi-GPU implementation that is capable of reconstructing high-resolution datasets from arbitrary projections. Its robustness and scalability are demonstrated for astronomical imagery from the Hubble Space Telescope. The resulting volumetric data is visualized using direct volume rendering. Compared to previous approaches, our method preserves a much higher amount of detail and visual variety in the 3D visualization, especially for objects with only approximate symmetry.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2012.281
Art and Aesthetics in Visualization,VAST,2010,Finding and visualizing relevant subspaces for clustering high-dimensional astronomical data using connected morphological operators - IEEE Conference Publication,"Data sets in astronomy are growing to enormous sizes. Modern astronomical surveys provide not only image data but also catalogues of millions of objects (stars, galaxies), each object with hundreds of associated parameters. Exploration of this very high-dimensional data space poses a huge challenge. Subspace clustering is one among several approaches which have been proposed for this purpose in recent years. However, many clustering algorithms require the user to set a large number of parameters without any guidelines. Some methods also do not provide a concise summary of the datasets, or, if they do, they lack additional important information such as the number of clusters present or the significance of the clusters. In this paper, we propose a method for ranking subspaces for clustering which overcomes many of the above limitations. First we carry out a transformation from parametric space to discrete image space where the data are represented by a grid-based density field. Then we apply so-called connected morphological operators on this density field of astronomical objects that provides visual support for the analysis of the important subspaces. Clusters in subspaces correspond to high-intensity regions in the density image. The importance of a cluster is measured by a new quality criterion based on the dynamics of local maxima of the density. Connected operators are able to extract such regions with an indication of the number of clusters present. The subspaces are visualized during computation of the quality measure, so that the user can interact with the system to improve the results. In the result stage, we use three visualization toolkits linked within a graphical user interface so that the user can perform an in-depth exploration of the ranked subspaces. Evaluation based on synthetic as well as real astronomical datasets demonstrates the power of the new method. We recover various known astronomical relations directly from the data with little or no a priori assumptions. Hence, our method holds good prospects for discovering new relations as well.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2010.5652450
Art and Aesthetics in Visualization,Vis,2009,Exploring the Millennium Run - Scalable Rendering of Large-Scale Cosmological Datasets,"In this paper we investigate scalability limitations in the visualization of large-scale particle-based cosmological simulations, and we present methods to reduce these limitations on current PC architectures. To minimize the amount of data to be streamed from disk to the graphics subsystem, we propose a visually continuous level- of-detail (LOD) particle representation based on a hierarchical quantization scheme for particle coordinates and rules for generating coarse particle distributions. Given the maximal world space error per level, our LOD selection technique guarantees a sub-pixel screen space error during rendering. A brick-based page-tree allows to further reduce the number of disk seek operations to be performed. Additional particle quantities like density, velocity dispersion, and radius are compressed at no visible loss using vector quantization of logarithmically encoded floating point values. By fine-grain view-frustum culling and presence acceleration in a geometry shader the required geometry throughput on the GPU can be significantly reduced. We validate the quality and scalability of our method by presenting visualizations of a particle-based cosmological dark-matter simulation exceeding 10 billion elements.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2009.142

Sunfall Data Taking has been in use for over eighteen months by a major international astrophysics collaboration (the largest data volume supernova search currently in operation), and has substantially improved the operational efficiency of its users.

Art and Aesthetics in Visualization,Vis,2008,Visualizing Multiwavelength Astrophysical Data,"With recent advances in the measurement technology for allsky astrophysical imaging, our view of the sky is no longer limited to the tiny visible spectral range over the 2D Celestial sphere. We now can access a third dimension corresponding to a broad electromagnetic spectrum with a wide range of allsky surveys; these surveys span frequency bands including long long wavelength radio, microwaves, very short X-rays, and gamma rays. These advances motivate us to study and examine multiwavelength visualization techniques to maximize our capabilities to visualize and exploit these informative image data sets. In this work, we begin with the processing of the data themselves, uniformizing the representations and units of raw data obtained from varied detector sources. Then we apply tools to map, convert, color-code, and format the multiwavelength data in forms useful for applications. We explore different visual representations for displaying the data, including such methods as textured image stacks, the horseshoe representation, and GPU-based volume visualization. A family of visual tools and analysis methods are introduced to explore the data, including interactive data mapping on the graphics processing unit (GPU), the mini-map explorer, and GPU-based interactive feature analysis.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2008.182
Art and Aesthetics in Visualization,Vis,2008,Surface Extraction from Multi-field Particle Volume Data Using Multi- dimensional Cluster Visualization,"Data sets resulting from physical simulations typically contain a multitude of physical variables. It is, therefore, desirable that visualization methods take into account the entire multi-field volume data rather than concentrating on one variable. We present a visualization approach based on surface extraction from multi-field particle volume data. The surfaces segment the data with respect to the underlying multi-variate function. Decisions on segmentation properties are based on the analysis of the multi-dimensional feature space. The feature space exploration is performed by an automated multi-dimensional hierarchical clustering method, whose resulting density clusters are shown in the form of density level sets in a 3D star coordinate layout. In the star coordinate layout, the user can select clusters of interest. A selected cluster in feature space corresponds to a segmenting surface in object space. Based on the segmentation property induced by the cluster membership, we extract a surface from the volume data. Our driving applications are smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations, where each particle carries multiple properties. The data sets are given in the form of unstructured point-based volume data. We directly extract our surfaces from such data without prior resampling or grid generation. The surface extraction computes individual points on the surface, which is supported by an efficient neighborhood computation. The extracted surface points are rendered using point-based rendering operations. Our approach combines methods in scientific visualization for object-space operations with methods in information visualization for feature-space operations.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2008.167
Art and Aesthetics in Visualization,Vis,2007,Visualization of Cosmological Particle-Based Datasets,"We describe our visualization process for a particle-based simulation of the formation of the first stars and their impact on cosmic history. The dataset consists of several hundred time-steps of point simulation data, with each time-step containing approximately two million point particles. For each time-step, we interpolate the point data onto a regular grid using a method taken from the radiance estimate of photon mapping [21]. We import the resulting regular grid representation into ParaView [24], with which we extract isosurfaces across multiple variables. Our images provide insights into the evolution of the early universe, tracing the cosmic transition from an initially homogeneous state to one of increasing complexity. Specifically, our visualizations capture the build-up of regions of ionized gas around the first stars, their evolution, and their complex interactions with the surrounding matter.

Art and Aesthetics in Visualization,Vis,2007,Visualizing Large-Scale Uncertainty in Astrophysical Data,"Visualization of uncertainty or error in astrophysical data is seldom available in simulations of astronomical phenomena, and yet almost all rendered attributes possess some degree of uncertainty due to observational error. Uncertainties associated with spatial location typically vary significantly with scale and thus introduce further complexity in the interpretation of a given visualization. This paper introduces effective techniques for visualizing uncertainty in large-scale virtual astrophysical environments. Building upon our previous transparently scalable visualization architecture, we develop tools that enhance the perception and comprehension of uncertainty across wide scale ranges. Our methods include a unified color-coding scheme for representing log-scale distances and percentage errors, an ellipsoid model to represent positional uncertainty, an ellipsoid envelope model to expose trajectory uncertainty, and a magic-glass design supporting the selection of ranges of log-scale distance and uncertainty parameters, as well as an overview mode and a scalable WIM tool for exposing the magnitudes of spatial context and uncertainty.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2007.70530
Art and Aesthetics in Visualization,Vis,2006,Scalable WIM: Effective Exploration in Large-scale Astrophysical Environments,"Navigating through large-scale virtual environments such as simulations of the astrophysical Universe is difficult. The huge spatial range of astronomical models and the dominance of empty space make it hard for users to travel across cosmological scales effectively, and the problem of wayfinding further impedes the user's ability to acquire reliable spatial knowledge of astronomical contexts. We introduce a new technique called the scalable world-in-miniature (WIM) map as a unifying interface to facilitate travel and wayfinding in a virtual environment spanning gigantic spatial scales: power-law spatial seating enables rapid and accurate transitions among widely separated regions; logarithmically mapped miniature spaces offer a global overview mode when the full context is too large; 3D landmarks represented in the WIM are enhanced by scale, positional, and directional cues to augment spatial context awareness; a series of navigation models are incorporated into the scalable WIM to improve the performance of travel tasks posed by the unique characteristics of virtual cosmic exploration.

Art and Aesthetics in Visualization,Vis,2006,Interactive Visualization of Intercluster Galaxy Structures in the Horologium- Reticulum Supercluster,"We present GyVe, an interactive visualization tool for understanding structure in sparse three-dimensional (3D) point data. The scientific goal driving the tool's development is to determine the presence of filaments and voids as defined by inferred 3D galaxy positions within the horologium-reticulum supercluster (HRS). GyVe provides visualization techniques tailored to examine structures defined by the intercluster galaxies. Specific techniques include: interactive user control to move between a global overview and local viewpoints, labelled axes and curved drop lines to indicate positions in the astronomical RA-DEC-cz coordinate system, torsional rocking and stereo to enhance 3D perception, and geometrically distinct glyphs to show potential correlation between intercluster galaxies and known clusters. We discuss the rationale for each design decision and review the success of the techniques in accomplishing the scientific goals. In practice, GyVe has been useful for gaining intuition about structures that were difficult to perceive with 2D projection techniques alone. For example, during their initial session with GyVe, our collaborators quickly confirmed scientific conclusions regarding the large-scale structure of the HRS previously obtained over months of study with 2D projections and statistical techniques. Further use of GyVe revealed the spherical shape of voids and showed that a presumed filament was actually two disconnected structures",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2006.155
Art and Aesthetics in Visualization,InfoVis,2005,A sky dome visualisation for identification of astronomical orientations - IEEE Conference Publication,"It has long been known that ancient temples were frequently oriented along the cardinal directions or to certain points along the horizon where Sun or Moon rise or set on special days of the year. In the last decades, archaeologists have found evidence of even older building structures buried in the soil, with doorways that also appear to have distinct orientations. This paper presents a novel diagram combining archaeological maps with a folded-apart, flattened view of the whole sky, showing the local horizon and the daily paths of Sun, Moon and brighter stars. By use of this diagram, interesting groupings of astronomical orientation directions, e.g. to certain Sunrise and Sunset points could be identified, which were evidently used to mark certain days of the year. Orientations to a few significant stars very likely indicated the beginning of the agricultural year in the middle neolithic period",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/INFVIS.2005.1532123
Art and Aesthetics in Visualization,Vis,2005,Visualization in the Einstein Year 2005: a case study on explanatory and illustrative visualization of relativity and astrophysics - IEEE Conference Publication,"In this application paper, we report on over fifteen years of experience with relativistic and astrophysical visualization, which has been culminating in a substantial engagement for visualization in the Einstein Year 2005 - the 100/sup th/ anniversary of Einstein's publications on special relativity, the photoelectric effect, and Brownian motion. This paper focuses on explanatory and illustrative visualizations used to communicate aspects of the difficult theories of special and general relativity, their geometric structure, and of the related fields of cosmology and astrophysics. We discuss visualization strategies, motivated by physics education and didactics of mathematics, and describe what kind of visualization methods have proven to be useful for different types of media, such as still images in popular-science magazines, film contributions to TV shows, oral presentations, or interactive museum installations. Although our visualization tools build upon existing methods and implementations, these techniques have been improved by several novel technical contributions like image-based special relativistic rendering on GPUs, an extension of general relativistic ray tracing to manifolds described by multiple charts, GPU-based interactive visualization of gravitational light deflection, as well as planetary terrain rendering. The usefulness and effectiveness of our visualizations are demonstrated by reporting on experiences with, and feedback from, recipients of visualizations and collaborators.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2005.1532845
Art and Aesthetics in Visualization,Vis,2005,Reflection nebula visualization - IEEE Conference Publication,"Stars form in dense clouds of interstellar gas and dust. The residual dust surrounding a young star scatters and diffuses its light, making the star's \""cocoon\"" of dust observable from Earth. The resulting structures, called reflection nebulae, are commonly very colorful in appearance due to wavelength-dependent effects in the scattering and extinction of light. The intricate interplay of scattering and extinction cause the color hues, brightness distributions, and the apparent shapes of such nebulae to vary greatly with viewpoint. We describe an interactive visualization tool for realistically rendering the appearance of arbitrary 3D dust distributions surrounding one or more illuminating stars. Our rendering algorithm is based on the physical models used in astrophysics research. The tool can be used to create virtual fly-throughs of reflection nebulae for interactive desktop visualizations, or to produce scientifically accurate animations for educational purposes, e.g., in planetarium shows. The algorithm is also applicable to investigate on-the-fly the visual effects of physical parameter variations, exploiting visualization technology to help gain a deeper and more intuitive understanding of the complex interaction of light and dust in real astrophysical settings.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2005.1532803
Art and Aesthetics in Visualization,Vis,2004,Constrained inverse volume rendering for planetary nebulae - IEEE Conference Publication,"Determining the three- dimensional structure of distant astronomical objects is a challenging task, given that terrestrial observations provide only one viewpoint. For this task, bipolar planetary nebulae are interesting objects of study because of their pronounced axial symmetry due to fundamental physical processes. Making use of this symmetry constraint, we present a technique to automatically recover the axisymmetric structure of bipolar planetary nebulae from two-dimensional images. With GPU-based volume rendering driving a nonlinear optimization, we estimate the nebula's local emission density as a function of its radial and axial coordinates, and we recover the orientation of the nebula relative to Earth. The optimization refines the nebula model and its orientation by minimizing the differences between the rendered image and the original astronomical image. The resulting model enables realistic 3D visualizations of planetary nebulae, e.g. for educational purposes in planetarium shows. In addition, the recovered spatial distribution of the emissive gas allows validating computer simulation results of the astrophysical formation processes of planetary nebulae.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2004.18
Astronomy / Astrophysics,InfoVis,2015,HOLA: Human-like Orthogonal Network Layout,"Over the last 50 years a wide variety of automatic network layout algorithms have been developed. Some are fast heuristic techniques suitable for networks with hundreds of thousands of nodes while others are multi-stage frameworks for higher-quality layout of smaller networks. However, despite decades of research currently no algorithm produces layout of comparable quality to that of a human. We give a new ""human-centred"" methodology for automatic network layout algorithm design that is intended to overcome this deficiency. User studies are first used to identify the aesthetic criteria algorithms should encode, then an algorithm is developed that is informed by these criteria and finally, a follow-up study evaluates the algorithm output. We have used this new methodology to develop an automatic orthogonal network layout method, HOLA, that achieves measurably better (by user study) layout than the best available orthogonal layout algorithm and which produces layouts of comparable quality to those produced by hand.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467451
Astronomy / Astrophysics,InfoVis,2014,Learning Perceptual Kernels for Visualization Design,"Visualization design can benefit from careful consideration of perception, as different assignments of visual encoding variables such as color, shape and size affect how viewers interpret data. In this work, we introduce perceptual kernels: distance matrices derived from aggregate perceptual judgments. Perceptual kernels represent perceptual differences between and within visual variables in a reusable form that is directly applicable to visualization evaluation and automated design. We report results from crowd-sourced experiments to estimate kernels for color, shape, size and combinations thereof. We analyze kernels estimated using five different judgment types-including Likert ratings among pairs, ordinal triplet comparisons, and manual spatial arrangement-and compare them to existing perceptual models. We derive recommendations for collecting perceptual similarities, and then demonstrate how the resulting kernels can be applied to automate visualization design decisions.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346978
Astronomy / Astrophysics,Vis,2011,The Effect of Colour and Transparency on the Perception of Overlaid Grids,"Overlaid reference elements need to be sufficiently visible to effectively relate to the underlying information, but not so obtrusive that they clutter the presentation. We seek to create guidelines for presenting such structures through experimental studies to define boundary conditions for visual intrusiveness. We base our work on the practice of designers, who use transparency to integrate overlaid grids with their underlying imagery. Previous work discovered a useful range of alpha values for black or white grids overlayed on scatterplot images rendered in shades of gray over gray backgrounds of different lightness values. This work compares black grids to blue and red ones on different image types of scatterplots and maps. We expected that the coloured grids over grayscale images would be more visually salient than black ones, resulting in lower alpha values. Instead, we found that there was no significant difference between the boundaries set for red and black grids, but that the boundaries for blue grids were set consistently higher (more opaque). As in our previous study, alpha values are affected by image density rather than image type, and are consistently lower than many default settings. These results have implications for the design of subtle reference structures.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2011.242
Astronomy / Astrophysics,InfoVis,2009,A Comparison of User-Generated and Automatic Graph Layouts,"The research presented in this paper compares user-generated and automatic graph layouts. Following the methods suggested by van Ham et al. (2008), a group of users generated graph layouts using both multi-touch interaction on a tabletop display and mouse interaction on a desktop computer. Users were asked to optimize their layout for aesthetics and analytical tasks with a social network. We discuss characteristics of the user-generated layouts and interaction methods employed by users in this process. We then report on a web-based study to compare these layouts with the output of popular automatic layout algorithms. Our results demonstrate that the best of the user-generated layouts performed as well as or better than the physics-based layout. Orthogonal and circular automatic layouts were found to be considerably less effective than either the physics-based layout or the best of the user- generated layouts. We highlight several attributes of the various layouts that led to high accuracy and improved task completion time, as well as aspects in which traditional automatic layout methods were unsuccessful for our tasks.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2009.109
Astronomy / Astrophysics,InfoVis,2007,Show Me: Automatic Presentation for Visual Analysis,"This paper describes Show Me, an integrated set of user interface commands and defaults that incorporate automatic presentation into a commercial visual analysis system called Tableau. A key aspect of Tableau is VizQL, a language for specifying views, which is used by Show Me to extend automatic presentation to the generation of tables of views (commonly called small multiple displays). A key research issue for the commercial application of automatic presentation is the user experience, which must support the flow of visual analysis. User experience has not been the focus of previous research on automatic presentation. The Show Me user experience includes the automatic selection of mark types, a command to add a single field to a view, and a pair of commands to build views for multiple fields. Although the use of these defaults and commands is optional, user interface logs indicate that Show Me is used by commercial users.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2007.70594
Astronomy / Astrophysics,InfoVis,2005,An optimization-based approach to dynamic visual context management - IEEE Conference Publication,"We are building an intelligent multimodal conversation system to aid users in exploring large and complex data sets. To tailor to diverse user queries introduced during a conversation, we automate the generation of system responses, including both spoken and visual outputs. In this paper, we focus on the problem of visual context management, a process that dynamically updates an existing visual display to effectively incorporate new information requested by subsequent user queries. Specifically, we develop an optimization based approach to visual context management. Compared to existing approaches, which normally handle predictable visual context updates, our work offers two unique contributions. First, we provide a general computational framework that can effectively manage a visual context for diverse, unanticipated situations encountered in a user system conversation. Moreover, we optimize the satisfaction of both semantic and visual constraints, which otherwise are difficult to balance using simple heuristics. Second, we present an extensible representation model that uses feature based metrics to uniformly define all constraints. We have applied our work to two different applications and our evaluation has shown the promise of this work.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/INFVIS.2005.1532146
Astronomy / Astrophysics,InfoVis,2004,Expand-Ahead: A Space-Filling Strategy for Browsing Trees - IEEE Conference Publication,"Many tree browsers allow subtrees under a node to be collapsed or expanded, enabling the user to control screen space usage and selectively drill-down. However, explicit expansion of nodes can be tedious. Expand-ahead is a space-filling strategy by which some nodes are automatically expanded to fill available screen space, without expanding so far that nodes are shown at a reduced size or outside the viewport. This often allows a user exploring the tree to see further down the tree without the effort required in a traditional browser. It also means the user can sometimes drill-down a path faster, by skipping over levels of the tree that are automatically expanded for them. Expand-ahead differs from many detail-in-context techniques in that there is no scaling or distortion involved. We present 1D and 2D prototype implementations of expand-ahead, and identify various design issues and possible enhancements to our designs. Our prototypes support smooth, animated transitions between different views of a tree. We also present the results of a controlled experiment which show that, under certain conditions, users are able to drill-down faster with expand- ahead than without",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/INFVIS.2004.21
Astronomy / Astrophysics,Vis,2002,Scalable alignment of large-format multi-projector displays using camera homography trees - IEEE Conference Publication,"This paper presents a vision-based geometric alignment system for aligning the projectors in an arbitrarily large display wall. Existing algorithms typically rely on a single camera view and degrade in accuracy as the display resolution exceeds the camera resolution by several orders of magnitude. Naive approaches to integrating multiple zoomed camera views fail since small errors in aligning adjacent views propagate quickly over the display surface to create glaring discontinuities. Our algorithm builds and refines a camera homography tree to automatically register any number of uncalibrated camera images; the resulting system is both faster and significantly more accurate than competing approaches, reliably achieving alignment errors of 0.55 pixels on a 24-projector display in under 9 minutes. Detailed experiments compare our system to two recent display wall alignment algorithms, both on our 18 Megapixel display wall and in simulation. These results indicate that our approach achieves sub-pixel accuracy even on displays with hundreds of projectors.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2002.1183793
Astronomy / Astrophysics,InfoVis,1996,On the semantics of interactive visualizations - IEEE Conference Publication,"Interactive techniques are powerful tools for manipulating visualizations to analyze, communicate and acquire information. This is especially true for large data sets or complex 3D visualizations. Although many new types of interaction have been introduced recently, very little work has been done on understanding what their components are, how they are related and how they can be combined. This paper begins to address these issues with a framework for classifying interactive visualizations. Our goal is a framework that will enable us to develop toolkits for assembling visualization interfaces both interactively and automatically.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/INFVIS.1996.559213

This paradigm combines the strengths of manual and automated design by interspersing guiding design operations by the human user with the exploration of design alternatives by the computer. The approach is demonstrated in the context of the IVE design system, a CCAD environment for the design of scientific visualizations using a set of design rules that combine primitive visualization components in different ways. These alternatives are presented graphically to the user, who can browse through them, select the most promising visualization, and refine it manually.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1991.175819
Automatic Analysis / Visualization Techniques,InfoVis,2015,Vials: Visualizing Alternative Splicing of Genes,"Alternative splicing is a process by which the same DNA sequence is used to assemble different proteins, called protein isoforms. Alternative splicing works by selectively omitting some of the coding regions (exons) typically associated with a gene. Detection of alternative splicing is difficult and uses a combination of advanced data acquisition methods and statistical inference. Knowledge about the abundance of isoforms is important for understanding both normal processes and diseases and to eventually improve treatment through targeted therapies. The data, however, is complex and current visualizations for isoforms are neither perceptually efficient nor scalable. To remedy this, we developed Vials, a novel visual analysis tool that enables analysts to explore the various datasets that scientists use to make judgments about isoforms: the abundance of reads associated with the coding regions of the gene, evidence for junctions, i.e., edges connecting the coding regions, and predictions of isoform frequencies. Vials is scalable as it allows for the simultaneous analysis of many samples in multiple groups. Our tool thus enables experts to (a) identify patterns of isoform abundance in groups of samples and (b) evaluate the quality of the data. We demonstrate the value of our tool in case studies using publicly available datasets.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467911
Automatic Analysis / Visualization Techniques,SciVis,2015,Using maximum topology matching to explore differences in species distribution models - IEEE Conference Publication,"Species distribution models (SDM) are used to help understand what drives the distribution of various plant and animal species. These models are typically high dimensional scalar functions, where the dimensions of the domain correspond to predictor variables of the model algorithm. Understanding and exploring the differences between models help ecologists understand areas where their data or understanding of the system is incomplete and will help guide further investigation in these regions. These differences can also indicate an important source of model to model uncertainty. However, it is cumbersome and often impractical to perform this analysis using existing tools, which allows for manual exploration of the models usually as 1-dimensional curves. In this paper, we propose a topology- based framework to help ecologists explore the differences in various SDMs directly in the high dimensional domain. In order to accomplish this, we introduce the concept of maximum topology matching that computes a locality- aware correspondence between similar extrema of two scalar functions. The matching is then used to compute the similarity between two functions. We also design a visualization interface that allows ecologists to explore SDMs using their topological features and to study the differences between pairs of models found using maximum topological matching. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework through several use cases using different data sets and report the feedback obtained from ecologists.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/SciVis.2015.7429486
Automatic Analysis / Visualization Techniques,SciVis,2015,Reconstruction and Visualization of Coordinated 3D Cell Migration Based on Optical Flow,"Animal development is marked by the repeated reorganization of cells and cell populations, which ultimately determine form and shape of the growing organism. One of the central questions in developmental biology is to understand precisely how cells reorganize, as well as how and to what extent this reorganization is coordinated. While modern microscopes can record video data for every cell during animal development in 3D+t, analyzing these videos remains a major challenge: reconstruction of comprehensive cell tracks turned out to be very demanding especially with decreasing data quality and increasing cell densities. In this paper, we present an analysis pipeline for coordinated cellular motions in developing embryos based on the optical flow of a series of 3D images. We use numerical integration to reconstruct cellular long-term motions in the optical flow of the video, we take care of data validation, and we derive a LIC-based, dense flow visualization for the resulting pathlines. This approach allows us to handle low video quality such as noisy data or poorly separated cells, and it allows the biologists to get a comprehensive understanding of their data by capturing dynamic growth processes in stills. We validate our methods using three videos of growing fruit fly embryos.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467291

Existing clinical tools are often text-based and do not emphasize consistency, completeness, or granularity of phenotype reporting. This can impede clinical diagnosis and limit their utility to genetics researchers. Herein, we present PhenoBlocks, a novel visual analytics tool that supports the comparison of phenotypes between patients, or between a patient and the hallmark features of a disorder. An informal evaluation of PhenoBlocks with expert clinicians suggested that the visualization effectively guides the process of differential diagnosis and could reinforce the importance of complete, granular phenotypic reporting.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467733
Automatic Analysis / Visualization Techniques,VAST,2014,Visual analysis of patterns in multiple amino acid mutation graphs - IEEE Conference Publication,"Proteins are essential parts in all living organisms. They consist of sequences of amino acids. An interaction with reactive agent can stimulate a mutation at a specific position in the sequence. This mutation may set off a chain reaction, which effects other amino acids in the protein. Chain reactions need to be analyzed, as they may invoke unwanted side effects in drug treatment. A mutation chain is represented by a directed acyclic graph, where amino acids are connected by their mutation dependencies. As each amino acid may mutate individually, many mutation graphs exist. To determine important impacts of mutations, experts need to analyze and compare common patterns in these mutations graphs. Experts, however, lack suitable tools for this purpose. We present a new system for the search and the exploration of frequent patterns (i.e., motifs) in mutation graphs. We present a fast pattern search algorithm specifically developed for finding biologically relevant patterns in many mutation graphs (i.e., many labeled acyclic directed graphs). Our visualization system allows an interactive exploration and comparison of the found patterns. It enables locating the found patterns in the mutation graphs and in the 3D protein structures. In this way, potentially interesting patterns can be discovered. These patterns serve as starting point for a further biological analysis. In cooperation with biologists, we use our approach for analyzing a real world data set based on multiple HIV protease sequences.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2014.7042485
Automatic Analysis / Visualization Techniques,InfoVis,2013,DiffAni: Visualizing Dynamic Graphs with a Hybrid of Difference Maps and Animation,"Visualization of dynamically changing networks (graphs) is a significant challenge for researchers. Previous work has experimentally compared animation, small multiples, and other techniques, and found trade- offs between these. One potential way to avoid such trade-offs is to combine previous techniques in a hybrid visualization. We present two taxonomies of visualizations of dynamic graphs: one of non-hybrid techniques, and one of hybrid techniques. We also describe a prototype, called DiffAni, that allows a graph to be visualized as a sequence of three kinds of tiles: diff tiles that show difference maps over some time interval, animation tiles that show the evolution of the graph over some time interval, and small multiple tiles that show the graph state at an individual time slice. This sequence of tiles is ordered by time and covers all time slices in the data. An experimental evaluation of DiffAni shows that our hybrid approach has advantages over non- hybrid techniques in certain cases.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2013.149
Automatic Analysis / Visualization Techniques,InfoVis,2013,Variant View: Visualizing Sequence Variants in their Gene Context,"Scientists use DNA sequence differences between an individual's genome and a standard reference genome to study the genetic basis of disease. Such differences are called sequence variants, and determining their impact in the cell is difficult because it requires reasoning about both the type and location of the variant across several levels of biological context. In this design study, we worked with four analysts to design a visualization tool supporting variant impact assessment for three different tasks. We contribute data and task abstractions for the problem of variant impact assessment, and the carefully justified design and implementation of the Variant View tool. Variant View features an information-dense visual encoding that provides maximal information at the overview level, in contrast to the extensive navigation required by currently-prevalent genome browsers. We provide initial evidence that the tool simplified and accelerated workflows for these three tasks through three case studies. Finally, we reflect on the lessons learned in creating and refining data and task abstractions that allow for concise overviews of sprawling information spaces that can reduce or remove the need for the memory-intensive use of navigation.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2013.214
Automatic Analysis / Visualization Techniques,InfoVis,2013,Entourage: Visualizing Relationships between Biological Pathways using Contextual Subsets,"Biological pathway maps are highly relevant tools for many tasks in molecular biology. They reduce the complexity of the overall biological network by partitioning it into smaller manageable parts. While this reduction of complexity is their biggest strength, it is, at the same time, their biggest weakness. By removing what is deemed not important for the primary function of the pathway, biologists lose the ability to follow and understand cross-talks between pathways. Considering these cross-talks is, however, critical in many analysis scenarios, such as judging effects of drugs. In this paper we introduce Entourage, a novel visualization technique that provides contextual information lost due to the artificial partitioning of the biological network, but at the same time limits the presented information to what is relevant to the analyst's task. We use one pathway map as the focus of an analysis and allow a larger set of contextual pathways. For these context pathways we only show the contextual subsets, i.e., the parts of the graph that are relevant to a selection. Entourage suggests related pathways based on similarities and highlights parts of a pathway that are interesting in terms of mapped experimental data. We visualize interdependencies between pathways using stubs of visual links, which we found effective yet not obtrusive. By combining this approach with visualization of experimental data, we can provide domain experts with a highly valuable tool. We demonstrate the utility of Entourage with case studies conducted with a biochemist who researches the effects of drugs on pathways. We show that the technique is well suited to investigate interdependencies between pathways and to analyze, understand, and predict the effect that drugs have on different cell types.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2013.154
Automatic Analysis / Visualization Techniques,VAST,2013,HierarchicalTopics: Visually Exploring Large Text Collections Using Topic Hierarchies,"Analyzing large textual collections has become increasingly challenging given the size of the data available and the rate that more data is being generated. Topic-based text summarization methods coupled with interactive visualizations have presented promising approaches to address the challenge of analyzing large text corpora. As the text corpora and vocabulary grow larger, more topics need to be generated in order to capture the meaningful latent themes and nuances in the corpora. However, it is difficult for most of current topic-based visualizations to represent large number of topics without being cluttered or illegible. To facilitate the representation and navigation of a large number of topics, we propose a visual analytics system - HierarchicalTopic (HT). HT integrates a computational algorithm, Topic Rose Tree, with an interactive visual interface. The Topic Rose Tree constructs a topic hierarchy based on a list of topics. The interactive visual interface is designed to present the topic content as well as temporal evolution of topics in a hierarchical fashion. User interactions are provided for users to make changes to the topic hierarchy based on their mental model of the topic space. To qualitatively evaluate HT, we present a case study that showcases how HierarchicalTopics aid expert users in making sense of a large number of topics and discovering interesting patterns of topic groups. We have also conducted a user study to quantitatively evaluate the effect of hierarchical topic structure. The study results reveal that the HT leads to faster identification of large number of relevant topics. We have also solicited user feedback during the experiments and incorporated some suggestions into the current version of HierarchicalTopics.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2013.162
Automatic Analysis / Visualization Techniques,InfoVis,2012,Taxonomy-Based Glyph Design&#8212;with a Case Study on Visualizing Workflows of Biological Experiments,"Glyph- based visualization can offer elegant and concise presentation of multivariate information while enhancing speed and ease in visual search experienced by users. As with icon designs, glyphs are usually created based on the designers' experience and intuition, often in a spontaneous manner. Such a process does not scale well with the requirements of applications where a large number of concepts are to be encoded using glyphs. To alleviate such limitations, we propose a new systematic process for glyph design by exploring the parallel between the hierarchy of concept categorization and the ordering of discriminative capacity of visual channels. We examine the feasibility of this approach in an application where there is a pressing need for an efficient and effective means to visualize workflows of biological experiments. By processing thousands of workflow records in a public archive of biological experiments, we demonstrate that a cost-effective glyph design can be obtained by following a process of formulating a taxonomy with the aid of computation, identifying visual channels hierarchically, and defining application-specific abstraction and metaphors.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2012.271
Automatic Analysis / Visualization Techniques,InfoVis,2011,Sequence Surveyor: Leveraging Overview for Scalable Genomic Alignment Visualization,"In this paper, we introduce overview visualization tools for large-scale multiple genome alignment data. Genome alignment visualization and, more generally, sequence alignment visualization are an important tool for understanding genomic sequence data. As sequencing techniques improve and more data become available, greater demand is being placed on visualization tools to scale to the size of these new datasets. When viewing such large data, we necessarily cannot convey details, rather we specifically design overview tools to help elucidate large-scale patterns. Perceptual science, signal processing theory, and generality provide a framework for the design of such visualizations that can scale well beyond current approaches. We present Sequence Surveyor, a prototype that embodies these ideas for scalable multiple whole-genome alignment overview visualization. Sequence Surveyor visualizes sequences in parallel, displaying data using variable color, position, and aggregation encodings. We demonstrate how perceptual science can inform the design of visualization techniques that remain visually manageable at scale and how signal processing concepts can inform aggregation schemes that highlight global trends, outliers, and overall data distributions as the problem scales. These techniques allow us to visualize alignments with over 100 whole bacterial-sized genomes.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2011.232
Automatic Analysis / Visualization Techniques,VAST,2011,A visual navigation system for querying neural stem cell imaging data - IEEE Conference Publication,"Cellular biology deals with studying the behavior of cells. Current time-lapse imaging microscopes help us capture the progress of experiments at intervals that allow for understanding of the dynamic and kinematic behavior of the cells. On the other hand, these devices generate such massive amounts of data (250GB of data per experiment) that manual sieving of data to identify interesting patterns becomes virtually impossible. In this paper we propose an end-to-end system to analyze time-lapse images of the cultures of human neural stem cells (hNSC), that includes an image processing system to analyze the images to extract all the relevant geometric and statistical features within and between images, a database management system to manage and handle queries on the data, a visual analytic system to navigate through the data, and a visual query system to explore different relationships and correlations between the parameters. In each stage of the pipeline we make novel algorithmic and conceptual contributions, and the entire system design is motivated by many different yet unanswered exploratory questions pursued by our neurobiologist collaborators. With a few examples we show how such abstract biological queries can be analyzed and answered by our system.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2011.6102459
Automatic Analysis / Visualization Techniques,Vis,2011,iView: A Feature Clustering Framework for Suggesting Informative Views in Volume Visualization,"The unguided visual exploration of volumetric data can be both a challenging and a time-consuming undertaking. Identifying a set of favorable vantage points at which to start exploratory expeditions can greatly reduce this effort and can also ensure that no important structures are being missed. Recent research efforts have focused on entropy-based viewpoint selection criteria that depend on scalar values describing the structures of interest. In contrast, we propose a viewpoint suggestion pipeline that is based on feature-clustering in high- dimensional space. We use gradient/normal variation as a metric to identify interesting local events and then cluster these via k-means to detect important salient composite features. Next, we compute the maximum possible exposure of these composite feature for different viewpoints and calculate a 2D entropy map parameterized in longitude and latitude to point out promising view orientations. Superimposed onto an interactive track-ball interface, users can then directly use this entropy map to quickly navigate to potentially interesting viewpoints where visibility-based transfer functions can be employed to generate volume renderings that minimize occlusions. To give full exploration freedom to the user, the entropy map is updated on the fly whenever a view has been selected, pointing to new and promising but so far unseen view directions. Alternatively, our system can also use a set-cover optimization algorithm to provide a minimal set of views needed to observe all features. The views so generated could then be saved into a list for further inspection or into a gallery for a summary presentation.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2011.218
Automatic Analysis / Visualization Techniques,Vis,2011,"Interactive, Graph-based Visual Analysis of High-dimensional, Multi-parameter Fluorescence Microscopy Data in Toponomics","In Toponomics, the function protein pattern in cells or tissue (the toponome) is imaged and analyzed for applications in toxicology, new drug development and patient-drug-interaction. The most advanced imaging technique is robot-driven multi-parameter fluorescence microscopy. This technique is capable of co-mapping hundreds of proteins and their distribution and assembly in protein clusters across a cell or tissue sample by running cycles of fluorescence tagging with monoclonal antibodies or other affinity reagents, imaging, and bleaching in situ. The imaging results in complex multi-parameter data composed of one slice or a 3D volume per affinity reagent. Biologists are particularly interested in the localization of co-occurring proteins, the frequency of co-occurrence and the distribution of co-occurring proteins across the cell. We present an interactive visual analysis approach for the evaluation of multi-parameter fluorescence microscopy data in toponomics. Multiple, linked views facilitate the definition of features by brushing multiple dimensions. The feature specification result is linked to all views establishing a focus+context visualization in 3D. In a new attribute view, we integrate techniques from graph visualization. Each node in the graph represents an affinity reagent while each edge represents two co-occurring affinity reagent bindings. The graph visualization is enhanced by glyphs which encode specific properties of the binding. The graph view is equipped with brushing facilities. By brushing in the spatial and attribute domain, the biologist achieves a better understanding of the function protein patterns of a cell. Furthermore, an interactive table view is integrated which summarizes unique fluorescence patterns. We discuss our approach with respect to a cell probe containing lymphocytes and a prostate tissue section.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2011.217
Automatic Analysis / Visualization Techniques,Vis,2011,Extinction-Based Shading and Illumination in GPU Volume Ray-Casting,"Direct volume rendering has become a popular method for visualizing volumetric datasets. Even though computers are continually getting faster, it remains a challenge to incorporate sophisticated illumination models into direct volume rendering while maintaining interactive frame rates. In this paper, we present a novel approach for advanced illumination in direct volume rendering based on GPU ray-casting. Our approach features directional soft shadows taking scattering into account, ambient occlusion and color bleeding effects while achieving very competitive frame rates. In particular, multiple dynamic lights and interactive transfer function changes are fully supported. Commonly, direct volume rendering is based on a very simplified discrete version of the original volume rendering integral, including the development of the original exponential extinction into a-blending. In contrast to a-blending forming a product when sampling along a ray, the original exponential extinction coefficient is an integral and its discretization a Riemann sum. The fact that it is a sum can cleverly be exploited to implement volume lighting effects, i.e. soft directional shadows, ambient occlusion and color bleeding. We will show how this can be achieved and how it can be implemented on the GPU.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2011.198
Automatic Analysis / Visualization Techniques,Vis,2011,Vortex Visualization in Ultra Low Reynolds Number Insect Flight,"We present the visual analysis of a biologically inspired CFD simulation of the deformable flapping wings of a dragonfly as it takes off and begins to maneuver, using vortex detection and integration-based flow lines. The additional seed placement and perceptual challenges introduced by having multiple dynamically deforming objects in the highly unsteady 3D flow domain are addressed. A brief overview of the high speed photogrammetry setup used to capture the dragonfly takeoff, parametric surfaces used for wing reconstruction, CFD solver and underlying flapping flight theory is presented to clarify the importance of several unsteady flight mechanisms, such as the leading edge vortex, that are captured visually. A novel interactive seed placement method is used to simplify the generation of seed curves that stay in the vicinity of relevant flow phenomena as they move with the flapping wings. This method allows a user to define and evaluate the quality of a seed's trajectory over time while working with a single time step. The seed curves are then used to place particles, streamlines and generalized streak lines. The novel concept of flowing seeds is also introduced in order to add visual context about the instantaneous vector fields surrounding smoothly animate streak lines. Tests show this method to be particularly effective at visually capturing vortices that move quickly or that exist for a very brief period of time. In addition, an automatic camera animation method is used to address occlusion issues caused when animating the immersed wing boundaries alongside many geometric flow lines. Each visualization method is presented at multiple time steps during the up-stroke and down-stroke to highlight the formation, attachment and shedding of the leading edge vortices in pairs of wings. Also, the visualizations show evidence of wake capture at stroke reversal which suggests the existence of previously unknown unsteady lift generation mechanisms that are unique to quad wing insects.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2011.260

The visualization takes the form of a diagonally-filled matrix, where rows are individuals and columns are nuclear families. After identifying the major tasks performed in genealogical research and the limits of current software, we present an interactive genealogy exploration system based on GeneaQuilts. The system includes an overview, a timeline, search and filtering components, and a new interaction technique called Bring & Slide that allows fluid navigation in very large genealogies. We report on preliminary feedback from domain experts and show how our system supports a number of their tasks.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2010.159
Automatic Analysis / Visualization Techniques,InfoVis,2010,"PedVis: A Structured, Space-Efficient Technique for Pedigree Visualization","Public genealogical databases are becoming increasingly populated with historical data and records of the current population's ancestors. As this increasing amount of available information is used to link individuals to their ancestors, the resulting trees become deeper and more dense, which justifies the need for using organized, space-efficient layouts to display the data. Existing layouts are often only able to show a small subset of the data at a time. As a result, it is easy to become lost when navigating through the data or to lose sight of the overall tree structure. On the contrary, leaving space for unknown ancestors allows one to better understand the tree's structure, but leaving this space becomes expensive and allows fewer generations to be displayed at a time. In this work, we propose that the H-tree based layout be used in genealogical software to display ancestral trees. We will show that this layout presents an increase in the number of displayable generations, provides a nicely arranged, symmetrical, intuitive and organized fractal structure, increases the user's ability to understand and navigate through the data, and accounts for the visualization requirements necessary for displaying such trees. Finally, user- study results indicate potential for user acceptance of the new layout.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2010.185
Automatic Analysis / Visualization Techniques,InfoVis,2010,"Comparative Analysis of Multidimensional, Quantitative Data","When analyzing multidimensional, quantitative data, the comparison of two or more groups of dimensions is a common task. Typical sources of such data are experiments in biology, physics or engineering, which are conducted in different configurations and use replicates to ensure statistically significant results. One common way to analyze this data is to filter it using statistical methods and then run clustering algorithms to group similar values. The clustering results can be visualized using heat maps, which show differences between groups as changes in color. However, in cases where groups of dimensions have an a priori meaning, it is not desirable to cluster all dimensions combined, since a clustering algorithm can fragment continuous blocks of records. Furthermore, identifying relevant elements in heat maps becomes more difficult as the number of dimensions increases. To aid in such situations, we have developed Matchmaker, a visualization technique that allows researchers to arbitrarily arrange and compare multiple groups of dimensions at the same time. We create separate groups of dimensions which can be clustered individually, and place them in an arrangement of heat maps reminiscent of parallel coordinates. To identify relations, we render bundled curves and ribbons between related records in different groups. We then allow interactive drill-downs using enlarged detail views of the data, which enable in-depth comparisons of clusters between groups. To reduce visual clutter, we minimize crossings between the views. This paper concludes with two case studies. The first demonstrates the value of our technique for the comparison of clustering algorithms. In the second, biologists use our system to investigate why certain strains of mice develop liver disease while others remain healthy, informally showing the efficacy of our system when analyzing multidimensional data containing distinct groups of dimensions.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2010.138
Automatic Analysis / Visualization Techniques,InfoVis,2010,Gremlin: An Interactive Visualization Model for Analyzing Genomic Rearrangements,"In this work we present, apply, and evaluate a novel, interactive visualization model for comparative analysis of structural variants and rearrangements in human and cancer genomes, with emphasis on data integration and uncertainty visualization. To support both global trend analysis and local feature detection, this model enables explorations continuously scaled from the high-level, complete genome perspective, down to the low-level, structural rearrangement view, while preserving global context at all times. We have implemented these techniques in Gremlin, a genomic rearrangement explorer with multi-scale, linked interactions, which we apply to four human cancer genome data sets for evaluation. Using an insight-based evaluation methodology, we compare Gremlin to Circos, the state-of-the-art in genomic rearrangement visualization, through a small user study with computational biologists working in rearrangement analysis. Results from user study evaluations demonstrate that this visualization model enables more total insights, more insights per minute, and more complex insights than the current state-of-the-art for visual analysis and exploration of genome rearrangements.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2010.163
Automatic Analysis / Visualization Techniques,Vis,2010,"Fast, Memory-Efficient Cell Location in Unstructured Grids for Visualization","Applying certain visualization techniques to datasets described on unstructured grids requires the interpolation of variables of interest at arbitrary locations within the dataset's domain of definition. Typical solutions to the problem of finding the grid element enclosing a given interpolation point make use of a variety of spatial subdivision schemes. However, existing solutions are memory- intensive, do not scale well to large grids, or do not work reliably on grids describing complex geometries. In this paper, we propose a data structure and associated construction algorithm for fast cell location in unstructured grids, and apply it to the interpolation problem. Based on the concept of bounding interval hierarchies, the proposed approach is memory-efficient, fast and numerically robust. We examine the performance characteristics of the proposed approach and compare it to existing approaches using a number of benchmark problems related to vector field visualization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach can successfully accommodate large datasets, and discuss application to visualization on both CPUs and GPUs.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2010.156
Automatic Analysis / Visualization Techniques,Vis,2010,Computing Robustness and Persistence for Images,"We are interested in 3-dimensional images given as arrays of voxels with intensity values. Extending these values to a continuous function, we study the robustness of homology classes in its level and interlevel sets, that is, the amount of perturbation needed to destroy these classes. The structure of the homology classes and their robustness, over all level and interlevel sets, can be visualized by a triangular diagram of dots obtained by computing the extended persistence of the function. We give a fast hierarchical algorithm using the dual complexes of oct-tree approximations of the function. In addition, we show that for balanced oct- trees, the dual complexes are geometrically realized in R3 and can thus be used to construct level and interlevel sets. We apply these tools to study 3-dimensional images of plant root systems.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2010.139
Automatic Analysis / Visualization Techniques,InfoVis,2009,GeneShelf: A Web-based Visual Interface for Large Gene Expression Time-Series Data Repositories,"A widespread use of high-throughput gene expression analysis techniques enabled the biomedical research community to share a huge body of gene expression datasets in many public databases on the web. However, current gene expression data repositories provide static representations of the data and support limited interactions. This hinders biologists from effectively exploring shared gene expression datasets. Responding to the growing need for better interfaces to improve the utility of the public datasets, we have designed and developed a new web-based visual interface entitled GeneShelf (http://bioinformatics.cnmcresearch.org/GeneShelf). It builds upon a zoomable grid display to represent two categorical dimensions. It also incorporates an augmented timeline with expandable time points that better shows multiple data values for the focused time point by embedding bar charts. We applied GeneShelf to one of the largest microarray datasets generated to study the progression and recovery process of injuries at the spinal cord of mice and rats. We present a case study and a preliminary qualitative user study with biologists to show the utility and usability of GeneShelf.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2009.146
Automatic Analysis / Visualization Techniques,InfoVis,2009,MizBee: A Multiscale Synteny Browser,"In the field of comparative genomics, scientists seek to answer questions about evolution and genomic function by comparing the genomes of species to find regions of shared sequences. Conserve dsyntenic blocks are an important biological data abstraction for indicating regions of shared sequences. The goal of this work is to show multiple types of relationships at multiple scales in a way that is visually comprehensible in accordance with known perceptual principles. We present a task analysis for this domain where the fundamental questions asked by biologists can be understood by a characterization of relationships into the four types of proximity/location, size, orientation, and similarity/strength, and the four scales of genome, chromosome, block, and genomic feature. We also propose a new taxonomy of the design space for visually encoding conservation data. We present MizBee, a multiscale synteny browser with the unique property of providing interactive side-by-side views of the data across the range of scales supporting exploration of all of these relationship types. We conclude with case studies from two biologists who used MizBee to augment their previous automatic analysis work flow, providing anecdotal evidence about the efficacy of the system for the visualization of syntenic data, the analysis of conservation relationships, and the communication of scientific insights.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2009.167
Automatic Analysis / Visualization Techniques,InfoVis,2009,ABySS-Explorer: Visualizing Genome Sequence Assemblies,"One bottleneck in large- scale genome sequencing projects is reconstructing the full genome sequence from the short subsequences produced by current technologies. The final stages of the genome assembly process inevitably require manual inspection of data inconsistencies and could be greatly aided by visualization. This paper presents our design decisions in translating key data features identified through discussions with analysts into a concise visual encoding. Current visualization tools in this domain focus on local sequence errors making high- level inspection of the assembly difficult if not impossible. We present a novel interactive graph display, ABySS-Explorer, that emphasizes the global assembly structure while also integrating salient data features such as sequence length. Our tool replaces manual and in some cases pen-and-paper based analysis tasks, and we discuss how user feedback was incorporated into iterative design refinements. Finally, we touch on applications of this representation not initially considered in our design phase, suggesting the generality of this encoding for DNA sequence data.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2009.116
Automatic Analysis / Visualization Techniques,InfoVis,2009,Smooth Graphs for Visual Exploration of Higher-Order State Transitions,"In this paper, we present a new visual way of exploring state sequences in large observational time-series. A key advantage of our method is that it can directly visualize higher-order state transitions. A standard first order state transition is a sequence of two states that are linked by a transition. A higher-order state transition is a sequence of three or more states where the sequence of participating states are linked together by consecutive first order state transitions. Our method extends the current state-graph exploration methods by employing a two dimensional graph, in which higher-order state transitions are visualized as curved lines. All transitions are bundled into thick splines, so that the thickness of an edge represents the frequency of instances. The bundling between two states takes into account the state transitions before and after the transition. This is done in such a way that it forms a continuous representation in which any subsequence of the timeseries is represented by a continuous smooth line. The edge bundles in these graphs can be explored interactively through our incremental selection algorithm. We demonstrate our method with an application in exploring labeled time-series data from a biological survey, where a clustering has assigned a single label to the data at each time-point. In these sequences, a large number of cyclic patterns occur, which in turn are linked to specific activities. We demonstrate how our method helps to find these cycles, and how the interactive selection process helps to find and investigate activities.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2009.181
Automatic Analysis / Visualization Techniques,InfoVis,2009,Interaction Techniques for Selecting and Manipulating Subgraphs in Network Visualizations,"We present a novel and extensible set of interaction techniques for manipulating visualizations of networks by selecting subgraphs and then applying various commands to modify their layout or graphical properties. Our techniques integrate traditional rectangle and lasso selection, and also support selecting a node's neighbourhood by dragging out its radius (in edges) using a novel kind of radial menu. Commands for translation, rotation, scaling, or modifying graphical properties (such as opacity) and layout patterns can be performed by using a hotbox (a transiently popped-up, semi-transparent set of widgets) that has been extended in novel ways to integrate specification of commands with 1D or 2D arguments. Our techniques require only one mouse button and one keyboard key, and are designed for fast, gestural, in-place interaction. We present the design and integration of these interaction techniques, and illustrate their use in interactive graph visualization. Our techniques are implemented in NAViGaTOR, a software package for visualizing and analyzing biological networks. An initial usability study is also reported.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2009.151
Automatic Analysis / Visualization Techniques,InfoVis,2009,Spatiotemporal Analysis of Sensor Logs using Growth Ring Maps,"Spatiotemporal analysis of sensor logs is a challenging research field due to three facts: a) traditional two-dimensional maps do not support multiple events to occur at the same spatial location, b) three-dimensional solutions introduce ambiguity and are hard to navigate, and c) map distortions to solve the overlap problem are unfamiliar to most users. This paper introduces a novel approach to represent spatial data changing over time by plotting a number of non- overlapping pixels, close to the sensor positions in a map. Thereby, we encode the amount of time that a subject spent at a particular sensor to the number of plotted pixels. Color is used in a twofold manner; while distinct colors distinguish between sensor nodes in different regions, the colors' intensity is used as an indicator to the temporal property of the subjects' activity. The resulting visualization technique, called growth ring maps, enables users to find similarities and extract patterns of interest in spatiotemporal data by using humans' perceptual abilities. We demonstrate the newly introduced technique on a dataset that shows the behavior of healthy and Alzheimer transgenic, male and female mice. We motivate the new technique by showing that the temporal analysis based on hierarchical clustering and the spatial analysis based on transition matrices only reveal limited results. Results and findings are cross-validated using multidimensional scaling. While the focus of this paper is to apply our visualization for monitoring animal behavior, the technique is also applicable for analyzing data, such as packet tracing, geographic monitoring of sales development, or mobile phone capacity planning.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2009.182
Automatic Analysis / Visualization Techniques,VAST,2009,Using projection and 2D plots to visually reveal genetic mechanisms of complex human disorders - IEEE Conference Publication,"Gene mapping is a statistical method used to localize human disease genes to particular regions of the human genome. When performing such analysis, a genetic likelihood space is generated and sampled, which results in a multidimensional scalar field. Researchers are interested in exploring this likelihood space through the use of visualization. Previous efforts at visualizing this space, though, were slow and cumbersome, only showing a small portion of the space at a time, thus requiring the user to keep a mental picture of several views. We have developed a new technique that displays much more data at once by projecting the multidimensional data into several 2D plots. One plot is created for each parameter that shows the change along that parameter. A radial projection is used to create another plot that provides an overview of the high dimensional surface from the perspective of a single point. Linking and brushing between all the plots are used to determine relationships between parameters. We demonstrate our techniques on real world autism data, showing how to visually examine features of the high dimensional space.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2009.5333917

Automatic Analysis / Visualization Techniques,Vis,2009,Interactive Coordinated Multiple-View Visualization of Biomechanical Motion Data,"We present an interactive framework for exploring space-time and form-function relationships in experimentally collected high-resolution biomechanical data sets. These data describe complex 3D motions (e.g. chewing, walking, flying) performed by animals and humans and captured via high-speed imaging technologies, such as biplane fluoroscopy. In analyzing these 3D biomechanical motions, interactive 3D visualizations are important, in particular, for supporting spatial analysis. However, as researchers in information visualization have pointed out, 2D visualizations can also be effective tools for multi-dimensional data analysis, especially for identifying trends over time. Our approach, therefore, combines techniques from both 3D and 2D visualizations. Specifically, it utilizes a multi-view visualization strategy including a small multiples view of motion sequences, a parallel coordinates view, and detailed 3D inspection views. The resulting framework follows an overview first, zoom and filter, then details-on-demand style of analysis, and it explicitly targets a limitation of current tools, namely, supporting analysis and comparison at the level of a collection of motions rather than sequential analysis of a single or small number of motions. Scientific motion collections appropriate for this style of analysis exist in clinical work in orthopedics and physical rehabilitation, in the study of functional morphology within evolutionary biology, and in other contexts. An application is described based on a collaboration with evolutionary biologists studying the mechanics of chewing motions in pigs. Interactive exploration of data describing a collection of more than one hundred experimentally captured pig chewing cycles is described.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2009.152
Automatic Analysis / Visualization Techniques,InfoVis,2008,Cerebral: Visualizing Multiple Experimental Conditions on a Graph with Biological Context,"Systems biologists use interaction graphs to model the behavior of biological systems at the molecular level. In an iterative process, such biologists observe the reactions of living cells under various experimental conditions, view the results in the context of the interaction graph, and then propose changes to the graph model. These graphs serve as a form of dynamic knowledge representation of the biological system being studied and evolve as new insight is gained from the experimental data. While numerous graph layout and drawing packages are available, these tools did not fully meet the needs of our immunologist collaborators. In this paper, we describe the data information display needs of these immunologists and translate them into design decisions. These decisions led us to create Cerebral, a system that uses a biologically guided graph layout and incorporates experimental data directly into the graph display. Small multiple views of different experimental conditions and a data-driven parallel coordinates view enable correlations between experimental conditions to be analyzed at the same time that the data is viewed in the graph context. This combination of coordinated views allows the biologist to view the data from many different perspectives simultaneously. To illustrate the typical analysis tasks performed, we analyze two datasets using Cerebral. Based on feedback from our collaborators we conclude that Cerebral is a valuable tool for analyzing experimental data in the context of an interaction graph model.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2008.117
Automatic Analysis / Visualization Techniques,Vis,2008,Visualization of Cellular and Microvascular Relationships,"Understanding the structure of microvasculature structures and their relationship to cells in biological tissue is an important and complex problem. Brain microvasculature in particular is known to play an important role in chronic diseases. However, these networks are only visible at the microscopic level and can span large volumes of tissue. Due to recent advances in microscopy, large volumes of data can be imaged at the resolution necessary to reconstruct these structures. Due to the dense and complex nature of microscopy data sets, it is important to limit the amount of information displayed. In this paper, we describe methods for encoding the unique structure of microvascular data, allowing researchers to selectively explore microvascular anatomy. We also identify the queries most useful to researchers studying microvascular and cellular relationships. By associating cellular structures with our microvascular framework, we allow researchers to explore interesting anatomical relationships in dense and complex data sets.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2008.179

A graph theoretic analysis is given, which identifies why genealogical graphs can be difficult to draw. This motivates some novel graphical representations, including one based on a dual tree, a subgraph formed by the union of two trees. Dual trees can be drawn in various styles, including an indented outline style, and allow users to browse general multitrees in addition to genealogical graphs, by transitioning between different dual tree views.

Automatic Analysis / Visualization Techniques,Vis,2005,Differential protein expression analysis via liquid-chromatography/mass- spectrometry data visualization - IEEE Conference Publication,"Differential protein expression analysis is one of the main challenges in proteomics. It denotes the search for proteins, whose encoding genes are differentially expressed under a given experimental setup. An important task in this context is to identify the differentially expressed proteins or, more generally, all proteins present in the sample. One of the most promising and recently widely used approaches for protein identification is to cleave proteins into peptides, separate the peptides using liquid chromatography, and determine the masses of the separated peptides using mass spectrometry. The resulting data needs to be analyzed and matched against protein sequence databases. The analysis step is typically done by searching for intensity peaks in a large number of 2D graphs. We present an interactive visualization tool for the exploration of liquid-chromatography/mass-spectrometry data in a 3D space, which allows for the understanding of the data in its entirety and a detailed analysis of regions of interest. We compute differential expression over the liquid-chromatography/mass-spectrometry domain and embed it visually in our system.

In response, a wide variety of visualization tools have been created to facilitate data analysis. Biologists often face a dilemma in choosing the best tool for their situation. The tool that works best for one biologist may not work well for another due to differences in the type of insight they seek from their data. A primary purpose of a visualization tool is to provide domain- relevant insight into the data. Ideally, any user wants maximum information in the least possible time. In this paper we identify several distinct characteristics of insight that enable us to recognize and quantify it. Based on this, we empirically evaluate five popular microarray visualization tools.

ImageSurfer enables scientists to analyze relationships between multiple data sets obtained with confocal microscopy by providing 3D surface view, height field, and graphing tools. Each tool reduces the complexity of the problem by extracting a restricted subset of data: finding a region of interest in 3D; getting a sense of relative concentrations in 2D, and getting exact concentration values in 1D.

Automatic Analysis / Visualization Techniques,Vis,2004,Projecting tetrahedra without rendering artifacts - IEEE Conference Publication,"Hardware-accelerated direct volume rendering of unstructured volumetric meshes is often based on tetrahedral cell projection, in particular, the projected tetrahedra (PT) algorithm and its variants. Unfortunately, even implementations of the most advanced variants of the PT algorithm are very prone to rendering artifacts. In this work, we identify linear interpolation in screen coordinates as a cause for significant rendering artifacts and implement the correct perspective interpolation for the PT algorithm with programmable graphics hardware. We also demonstrate how to use features of modern graphics hardware to improve the accuracy of the coloring of individual tetrahedra and the compositing of the resulting colors, in particular, by employing a logarithmic scale for the preintegrated color lookup table, using textures with high color resolution, rendering to floating-point color buffers, and alpha dithering. Combined with a correct visibility ordering, these techniques result in the first implementation of the PT algorithm without objectionable rendering artifacts. Apart from the important improvement in rendering quality, our approach also provides a test bed for different implementations of the PT algorithm that allows us to study the particular rendering artifacts introduced by these variants.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2004.85

One of the more common procedures for microarray experimentation is that of the microarray time-course experiment. The product of microarray time-course experiment is time-series data, which subject to proper analysis has the potential to have significant impact on the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases. While existing information visualization techniques go some way to making microarray time-series data more manageable, requirements analysis has revealed significant limitations. The main finding was that users were unable to uncover and quantify common changes in value over a specified time-period. This paper describes a novel technique that provides this functionality by allowing the user to visually formulate and modify measurable queries with separate time-period and condition components. These visual queries are supported by the combination of a traditional value against time graph representation of the data with a complementary scatter-plot representation of a specified time-period. The multiple views of the visualization are coordinated so that the user can formulate and modify queries with rapid reversible display of query results in the traditional value against time graph format.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/INFVIS.2003.1249023

Our implementation avoids the memory transfer bottleneck of the graphics bus since the complete mesh data is stored in the local memory of the graphics adapter and all computations, in particular ray traversal and ray integration, are performed by the graphics processing unit. Analogously to other ray casting algorithms, our algorithm does not require an expensive cell sorting. Provided that the graphics adapter offers enough texture memory, our implementation performs comparable to the fastest published volume rendering algorithms for unstructured meshes. Our approach works with cyclic and/or non-convex meshes and supports early ray termination. Accurate ray integration is guaranteed by applying pre-integrated volume rendering.

Two dynamic visualization techniques are provided, a visualization of the movement of the regulatory proteins and a visualization of the relative concentrations of these proteins. Several interactive tools relate the dynamic visualizations to the underlying genetic network structure.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2002.1183781
Automatic Analysis / Visualization Techniques,Vis,2002,Interactive visualization of complex plant ecosystems - IEEE Conference Publication,"We present a method for interactive rendering of large outdoor scenes. Complex polygonal plant models and whole plant populations are represented by relatively small sets of point and line primitives. This enables us to show landscapes faithfully using only a limited percentage of primitives. In addition, a hierarchical data structure allows us to smoothly reduce the geometrical representation to any desired number of primitives. The scene is hierarchically divided into local portions of geometry to achieve large reduction factors for distant regions. Additionally, the data reduction is adapted to the visual importance of geometric objects. This allows us to maintain the visual fidelity of the representation while reducing most of the geometry drastically. With our system, we are able to interactively render very complex landscapes with good visual quality.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2002.1183778

Automatic Analysis / Visualization Techniques,Vis,2000,Hardware-accelerated volume and isosurface rendering based on cell-projection - IEEE Conference Publication,"We present two beneficial rendering extensions to the projected tetrahedra (PT) algorithm proposed by Shirley and Tuchman (1990). These extensions are compatible with any cell sorting technique, for example the BSP-XMPVO sorting algorithm for unstructured meshes. Using 3D texture mapping our first extension solves the longstanding problem of hardware-accelerated but accurate rendering of tetrahedral volume cells with arbitrary transfer functions. By employing 2D texture mapping our second extension realizes the hardware- accelerated rendering of multiple shaded isosurfaces within the PT algorithm without reconstructing the isosurfaces. Additionally, two methods are presented to combine projected tetrahedral volumes with isosurfaces. The time complexity of all our algorithms is linear in the number of tetrahedra and does neither depend on the number of isosurfaces nor on the employed transfer functions.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2000.885683
Automatic Analysis / Visualization Techniques,InfoVis,1999,3D interactive visualization for inter-cell dependencies of spreadsheets - IEEE Conference Publication,"This paper proposes a new technique to visualize dependencies among cells in a spreadsheet. In this way, the system firstly visualizes a spreadsheet on a plane in three-dimensional space, and draws arcs between interrelated cells. By allowing a user to select an arbitrary cell and lift it up with direct manipulation, the system utilizes the third dimension to ameliorate visual occlusion of crossing arcs. As the user lifts a focused cell up, the interrelated cells are lifted up together; thus hidden dataflow networks can be visually intelligible interactively. Because spreadsheets are aimed at calculation itself rather than appearances of outputs, their mechanism is relatively invisible and not obvious for ordinary users. Our visualization helps such users to understand structures and mechanism of spreadsheets.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/INFVIS.1999.801861
Automatic Analysis / Visualization Techniques,InfoVis,1998,Comparative visualization of protein structure-sequence alignments - IEEE Conference Publication,"Protein fold recognition (threading) involves the prediction of a protein's three- dimensional shape based on its similarity to a protein whose structure is known. Fold predictions are low resolution; no effort is made to rotate the protein's component amino acid side chains into their correct spatial orientations. Rather, the goal is to recognize the protein family member that most closely resembles the target sequence of unknown structure and to create a sensible alignment of the target to the structure (i.e., a structure- sequence alignment). To complement this structure prediction method the authors have implemented a low resolution molecular graphics tool. Since amino acid side chain orientation is not relevant in fold recognition, amino acid residues are represented by abstract shapes or glyphs much like Lego/sup TM/ blocks. They also borrow techniques from comparative streamline visualization to provide clean depictions of the entire protein structure model. By creating a low resolution representation of protein structure, they are able to approximately double the amount of information on the screen. This implementation also possesses the advantage of eliminating distracting and possibly misleading visual clutter resulting from the mapping of protein alignment information onto a high resolution display of a known structure.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/INFVIS.1998.729566
Automatic Analysis / Visualization Techniques,Vis,1998,Efficient warping for architectural walkthroughs using layered depth images - IEEE Conference Publication,"This paper presents efficient image-based rendering techniques used in the context of an architectural walkthrough system. Portals (doors and windows) are rendered by warping layered depth images (LDIs). In a preprocessing phase, for every portal, a number of pre- rendered images are combined into an LDI. The resulting LDI stores, exactly once, all surfaces visible in at least one of the images used in the construction, so most of the exposure errors are efficiently eliminated. The LDI can be warped in the McMillan occlusion compatible ordering. A substantial increase in performance is obtained by warping in parallel. Our parallelization scheme achieves good load balancing, scales with the number of processors, and preserves the occlusion compatible ordering. A fast, conservative reference-image-space clipping algorithm also reduces the warping effort.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1998.745305

The rendering complexity is reduced to the geometry of the current cell thus increasing interactive performance. A portal is a generalization of windows and doors. It connects two adjacent cells (or rooms). Each portal of the current cell that is some distance away from the viewpoint is rendered as a texture. The portal texture (smoothly) returns to geometry when the viewpoint gets close to the portal. This way all portal sequences (not too close to the viewpoint) have a depth complexity of one. The size of each texture and distance at which the transition occurs is configurable for each portal.,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1997.663903
Biology and Bioinformatics,InfoVis,2015,TimeSpan: Using Visualization to Explore Temporal Multi-dimensional Data of Stroke Patients,"We present TimeSpan, an exploratory visualization tool designed to gain a better understanding of the temporal aspects of the stroke treatment process. Working with stroke experts, we seek to provide a tool to help improve outcomes for stroke victims. Time is of critical importance in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke patients. Every minute that the artery stays blocked, an estimated 1.9 million neurons and 12 km of myelinated axons are destroyed. Consequently, there is a critical need for efficiency of stroke treatment processes. Optimizing time to treatment requires a deep understanding of interval times. Stroke health care professionals must analyze the impact of procedures, events, and patient attributes on time-ultimately, to save lives and improve quality of life after stroke. First, we interviewed eight domain experts, and closely collaborated with two of them to inform the design of TimeSpan. We classify the analytical tasks which a visualization tool should support and extract design goals from the interviews and field observations. Based on these tasks and the understanding gained from the collaboration, we designed TimeSpan, a web-based tool for exploring multi-dimensional and temporal stroke data. We describe how TimeSpan incorporates factors from stacked bar graphs, line charts, histograms, and a matrix visualization to create an interactive hybrid view of temporal data. From feedback collected from domain experts in a focus group session, we reflect on the lessons we learned from abstracting the tasks and iteratively designing TimeSpan.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467325
Biology and Bioinformatics,SciVis,2015,Occlusion-free Blood Flow Animation with Wall Thickness Visualization,"We present the first visualization tool that combines pathlines from blood flow and wall thickness information. Our method uses illustrative techniques to provide occlusion-free visualization of the flow. We thus offer medical researchers an effective visual analysis tool for aneurysm treatment risk assessment. Such aneurysms bear a high risk of rupture and significant treatment-related risks. Therefore, to get a fully informed decision it is essential to both investigate the vessel morphology and the hemodynamic data. Ongoing research emphasizes the importance of analyzing the wall thickness in risk assessment. Our combination of blood flow visualization and wall thickness representation is a significant improvement for the exploration and analysis of aneurysms. As all presented information is spatially intertwined, occlusion problems occur. We solve these occlusion problems by dynamic cutaway surfaces. We combine this approach with a glyph- based blood flow representation and a visual mapping of wall thickness onto the vessel surface. We developed a GPU-based implementation of our visualizations which facilitates wall thickness analysis through real-time rendering and flexible interactive data exploration mechanisms. We designed our techniques in collaboration with domain experts, and we provide details about the evaluation of the technique and tool.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467961
Biology and Bioinformatics,SciVis,2015,Real-time uncertainty visualization for B-mode ultrasound - IEEE Conference Publication,"B-mode ultrasound is a very well established imaging modality and is widely used in many of today's clinical routines. However, acquiring good images and interpreting them correctly is a challenging task due to the complex ultrasound image formation process depending on a large number of parameters. To facilitate ultrasound acquisitions, we introduce a novel framework for real-time uncertainty visualization in B-mode images. We compute real-time per-pixel ultrasound Confidence Maps, which we fuse with the original ultrasound image in order to provide the user with an interactive feedback on the quality and credibility of the image. In addition to a standard color overlay mode, primarily intended for educational purposes, we propose two perceptional visualization schemes to be used in clinical practice. Our mapping of uncertainty to chroma uses the perceptionally uniform L*a*b* color space to ensure that the perceived brightness of B-mode ultrasound remains the same. The alternative mapping of uncertainty to fuzziness keeps the B-mode image in its original grayscale domain and locally blurs or sharpens the image based on the uncertainty distribution. An elaborate evaluation of our system and user studies on both medical students and expert sonographers demonstrate the usefulness of our proposed technique. In particular for ultrasound novices, such as medical students, our technique yields powerful visual cues to evaluate the image quality and thereby learn the ultrasound image formation process. Furthermore, seeing the distribution of uncertainty adjust to the transducer positioning in real-time, provides also expert clinicians with a strong visual feedback on their actions. This helps them to optimize the acoustic window and can improve the general clinical value of ultrasound.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/SciVis.2015.7429489
Biology and Bioinformatics,SciVis,2015,Cluster Analysis of Vortical Flow in Simulations of Cerebral Aneurysm Hemodynamics,"Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations of blood flow provide new insights into the hemodynamics of vascular pathologies such as cerebral aneurysms. Understanding the relations between hemodynamics and aneurysm initiation, progression, and risk of rupture is crucial in diagnosis and treatment. Recent studies link the existence of vortices in the blood flow pattern to aneurysm rupture and report observations of embedded vortices - a larger vortex encloses a smaller one flowing in the opposite direction - whose implications are unclear. We present a clustering- based approach for the visual analysis of vortical flow in simulated cerebral aneurysm hemodynamics. We show how embedded vortices develop at saddle-node bifurcations on vortex core lines and convey the participating flow at full manifestation of the vortex by a fast and smart grouping of streamlines and the visualization of group representatives. The grouping result may be refined based on spectral clustering generating a more detailed visualization of the flow pattern, especially further off the core lines. We aim at supporting CFD engineers researching the biological implications of embedded vortices.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467203

Existing clinical tools are often text-based and do not emphasize consistency, completeness, or granularity of phenotype reporting. This can impede clinical diagnosis and limit their utility to genetics researchers. Herein, we present PhenoBlocks, a novel visual analytics tool that supports the comparison of phenotypes between patients, or between a patient and the hallmark features of a disorder. An informal evaluation of PhenoBlocks with expert clinicians suggested that the visualization effectively guides the process of differential diagnosis and could reinforce the importance of complete, granular phenotypic reporting.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467733

However, extracting cohorts from databases is a difficult yet important step, often overlooked in many analytical solutions. This is especially true when researchers wish to restrict their cohorts to exhibit a particular temporal pattern of interest. In order to fill this gap, we designed COQUITO, a visual interface that assists users defining cohorts with temporal constraints. COQUITO was designed to be comprehensible to domain experts with no preknowledge of database queries and also to encourage exploration. We then demonstrate the utility of COQUITO via two case studies, involving medical and social media researchers.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467622
Biology and Bioinformatics,VAST,2015,3D Regression Heat Map Analysis of Population Study Data,"Epidemiological studies comprise heterogeneous data about a subject group to define disease- specific risk factors. These data contain information (features) about a subject's lifestyle, medical status as well as medical image data. Statistical regression analysis is used to evaluate these features and to identify feature combinations indicating a disease (the target feature). We propose an analysis approach of epidemiological data sets by incorporating all features in an exhaustive regression-based analysis. This approach combines all independent features w.r.t. a target feature. It provides a visualization that reveals insights into the data by highlighting relationships. The 3D Regression Heat Map, a novel 3D visual encoding, acts as an overview of the whole data set. It shows all combinations of two to three independent features with a specific target disease. Slicing through the 3D Regression Heat Map allows for the detailed analysis of the underlying relationships. Expert knowledge about disease-specific hypotheses can be included into the analysis by adjusting the regression model formulas. Furthermore, the influences of features can be assessed using a difference view comparing different calculation results. We applied our 3D Regression Heat Map method to a hepatic steatosis data set to reproduce results from a data mining-driven analysis. A qualitative analysis was conducted on a breast density data set. We were able to derive new hypotheses about relations between breast density and breast lesions with breast cancer. With the 3D Regression Heat Map, we present a visual overview of epidemiological data that allows for the first time an interactive regression-based analysis of large feature sets with respect to a disease.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2468291
Biology and Bioinformatics,VAST,2015,VisOHC: Designing Visual Analytics for Online Health Communities,"Through online health communities (OHCs), patients and caregivers exchange their illness experiences and strategies for overcoming the illness, and provide emotional support. To facilitate healthy and lively conversations in these communities, their members should be continuously monitored and nurtured by OHC administrators. The main challenge of OHC administrators' tasks lies in understanding the diverse dimensions of conversation threads that lead to productive discussions in their communities. In this paper, we present a design study in which three domain expert groups participated, an OHC researcher and two OHC administrators of online health communities, which was conducted to find with a visual analytic solution. Through our design study, we characterized the domain goals of OHC administrators and derived tasks to achieve these goals. As a result of this study, we propose a system called VisOHC, which visualizes individual OHC conversation threads as collapsed boxes-a visual metaphor of conversation threads. In addition, we augmented the posters' reply authorship network with marks and/or beams to show conversation dynamics within threads. We also developed unique measures tailored to the characteristics of OHCs, which can be encoded for thread visualizations at the users' requests. Our observation of the two administrators while using VisOHC showed that it supports their tasks and reveals interesting insights into online health communities. Finally, we share our methodological lessons on probing visual designs together with domain experts by allowing them to freely encode measurements into visual variables.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467555
Biology and Bioinformatics,VAST,2015,Integrating predictive analytics into a spatiotemporal epidemic simulation - IEEE Conference Publication,"The Epidemic Simulation System (EpiSimS) is a scalable, complex modeling tool for analyzing disease within the United States. Due to its high input dimensionality, time requirements, and resource constraints, simulating over the entire parameter space is unfeasible. One solution is to take a granular sampling of the input space and use simpler predictive models (emulators) in between. The quality of the implemented emulator depends on many factors: robustness, sophistication, configuration, and suitability to the input data. Visual analytics can be leveraged to provide guidance and understanding of these things to the user. In this paper, we have implemented a novel interface and workflow for emulator building and use. We introduce a workflow to build emulators, make predictions, and then analyze the results. Our prediction process first predicts temporal time series, and uses these to derive predicted spatial densities. Integrated into the EpiSimS framework, we target users who are non-experts at statistical modeling. This approach allows for a high level of analysis into the state of the built emulators and their resultant predictions. We present our workflow, models, the associated system, and evaluate the overall utility with feedback from EpiSimS scientists.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2015.7347626

In the past, they have mostly been used for artistic, communicative or educational purposes, and designers of data sculptures argue that in such situations, physical visualizations can be more enriching than pixel-based visualizations. We present the design of Activity Sculptures: data sculptures of running activity. In a three-week field study we investigated the impact of the sculptures on 14 participants' running activity, the personal and social behaviors generated by the sculptures, as well as participants' experiences when receiving these individual physical tokens generated from the specific data of their runs. The physical rewards generated curiosity and personal experimentation but also social dynamics such as discussion on runs or envy/competition.

Biology and Bioinformatics,SciVis,2014,Combined Visualization of Wall Thickness and Wall Shear Stress for the Evaluation of Aneurysms,"For an individual rupture risk assessment of aneurysms, the aneurysm's wall morphology and hemodynamics provide valuable information. Hemodynamic information is usually extracted via computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulation on a previously extracted 3D aneurysm surface mesh or directly measured with 4D phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging. In contrast, a noninvasive imaging technique that depicts the aneurysm wall in vivo is still not available. Our approach comprises an experiment, where intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is employed to probe a dissected saccular aneurysm phantom, which we modeled from a porcine kidney artery. Then, we extracted a 3D surface mesh to gain the vessel wall thickness and hemodynamic information from a CFD simulation. Building on this, we developed a framework that depicts the inner and outer aneurysm wall with dedicated information about local thickness via distance ribbons. For both walls, a shading is adapted such that the inner wall as well as its distance to the outer wall is always perceivable. The exploration of the wall is further improved by combining it with hemodynamic information from the CFD simulation. Hence, the visual analysis comprises a brushing and linking concept for individual highlighting of pathologic areas. Also, a surface clustering is integrated to provide an automatic division of different aneurysm parts combined with a risk score depending on wall thickness and hemodynamic information. In general, our approach can be employed for vessel visualization purposes where an inner and outer wall has to be adequately represented.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346406
Biology and Bioinformatics,SciVis,2014,ADR - Anatomy-Driven Reformation,"Dedicated visualization methods are among the most important tools of modern computer-aided medical applications. Reformation methods such as Multiplanar Reformation or Curved Planar Reformation have evolved as useful tools that facilitate diagnostic and therapeutic work. In this paper, we present a novel approach that can be seen as a generalization of Multiplanar Reformation to curved surfaces. The main concept is to generate reformatted medical volumes driven by the individual anatomical geometry of a specific patient. This process generates flat views of anatomical structures that facilitate many tasks such as diagnosis, navigation and annotation. Our reformation framework is based on a non-linear as-rigid-as-possible volumetric deformation scheme that uses generic triangular surface meshes as input. To manage inevitable distortions during reformation, we introduce importance maps which allow controlling the error distribution and improving the overall visual quality in areas of elevated interest. Our method seamlessly integrates with well-established concepts such as the slice-based inspection of medical datasets and we believe it can improve the overall efficiency of many medical workflows. To demonstrate this, we additionally present an integrated visualization system and discuss several use cases that substantiate its benefits.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346405
Biology and Bioinformatics,SciVis,2014,Ligand Excluded Surface: A New Type of Molecular Surface,"The most popular molecular surface in molecular visualization is the solvent excluded surface (SES). It provides information about the accessibility of a biomolecule for a solvent molecule that is geometrically approximated by a sphere. During a period of almost four decades, the SES has served for many purposes - including visualization, analysis of molecular interactions and the study of cavities in molecular structures. However, if one is interested in the surface that is accessible to a molecule whose shape differs significantly from a sphere, a different concept is necessary. To address this problem, we generalize the definition of the SES by replacing the probe sphere with the full geometry of the ligand defined by the arrangement of its van der Waals spheres. We call the new surface ligand excluded surface (LES) and present an efficient, grid-based algorithm for its computation. Furthermore, we show that this algorithm can also be used to compute molecular cavities that could host the ligand molecule. We provide a detailed description of its implementation on CPU and GPU. Furthermore, we present a performance and convergence analysis and compare the LES for several molecules, using as ligands either water or small organic molecules.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346404
Biology and Bioinformatics,SciVis,2014,Predicate-Based Focus-and-Context Visualization for 3D Ultrasound,"Direct volume visualization techniques offer powerful insight into volumetric medical images and are part of the clinical routine for many applications. Up to now, however, their use is mostly limited to tomographic imaging modalities such as CT or MRI. With very few exceptions, such as fetal ultrasound, classic volume rendering using one-dimensional intensity-based transfer functions fails to yield satisfying results in case of ultrasound volumes. This is particularly due its gradient-like nature, a high amount of noise and speckle, and the fact that individual tissue types are rather characterized by a similar texture than by similar intensity values. Therefore, clinicians still prefer to look at 2D slices extracted from the ultrasound volume. In this work, we present an entirely novel approach to the classification and compositing stage of the volume rendering pipeline, specifically designed for use with ultrasonic images. We introduce point predicates as a generic formulation for integrating the evaluation of not only low-level information like local intensity or gradient, but also of high-level information, such as non-local image features or even anatomical models. Thus, we can successfully filter clinically relevant from non-relevant information. In order to effectively reduce the potentially high dimensionality of the predicate configuration space, we propose the predicate histogram as an intuitive user interface. This is augmented by a scribble technique to provide a comfortable metaphor for selecting predicates of interest. Assigning importance factors to the predicates allows for focus-and-context visualization that ensures to always show important (focus) regions of the data while maintaining as much context information as possible. Our method naturally integrates into standard ray casting algorithms and yields superior results in comparison to traditional methods in terms of visualizing a specific target anatomy in ultrasound volumes.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346317
Biology and Bioinformatics,SciVis,2014,Stent Maps -- Comparative Visualization for the Prediction of Adverse Events of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantations,"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a minimally-invasive method for the treatment of aortic valve stenosis in patients with high surgical risk. Despite the success of TAVI, side effects such as paravalvular leakages can occur postoperatively. The goal of this project is to quantitatively analyze the co-occurrence of this complication and several potential risk factors such as stent shape after implantation, implantation height, amount and distribution of calcifications, and contact forces between stent and surrounding structure. In this paper, we present a two-dimensional visualization (stent maps), which allows (1) to comprehensively display all these aspects from CT data and mechanical simulation results and (2) to compare different datasets to identify patterns that are typical for adverse effects. The area of a stent map represents the surface area of the implanted stent - virtually straightened and uncoiled. Several properties of interest, like radial forces or stent compression, are displayed in this stent map in a heatmap-like fashion. Important anatomical landmarks and calcifications are plotted to show their spatial relation to the stent and possible correlations with the color-coded parameters. To provide comparability, the maps of different patient datasets are spatially adjusted according to a corresponding anatomical landmark. Also, stent maps summarizing the characteristics of different populations (e.g. with or without side effects) can be generated. Up to this point several interesting patterns have been observed with our technique, which remained hidden when examining the raw CT data or 3D visualizations of the same data. One example are obvious radial force maxima between the right and non-coronary valve leaflet occurring mainly in cases without leakages. These observations confirm the usefulness of our approach and give starting points for new hypotheses and further analyses. Because of its reduced dimensionality, the stent map data is an appropriate input for statistical group evaluation and machine learning methods.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346459
Biology and Bioinformatics,SciVis,2014,Trend-Centric Motion Visualization: Designing and Applying a New Strategy for Analyzing Scientific Motion Collections,"In biomechanics studies, researchers collect, via experiments or simulations, datasets with hundreds or thousands of trials, each describing the same type of motion (e.g., a neck flexion-extension exercise) but under different conditions (e.g., different patients, different disease states, pre- and post-treatment). Analyzing similarities and differences across all of the trials in these collections is a major challenge. Visualizing a single trial at a time does not work, and the typical alternative of juxtaposing multiple trials in a single visual display leads to complex, difficult-to-interpret visualizations. We address this problem via a new strategy that organizes the analysis around motion trends rather than trials. This new strategy matches the cognitive approach that scientists would like to take when analyzing motion collections. We introduce several technical innovations making trend-centric motion visualization possible. First, an algorithm detects a motion collection's trends via time-dependent clustering. Second, a 2D graphical technique visualizes how trials leave and join trends. Third, a 3D graphical technique, using a median 3D motion plus a visual variance indicator, visualizes the biomechanics of the set of trials within each trend. These innovations are combined to create an interactive exploratory visualization tool, which we designed through an iterative process in collaboration with both domain scientists and a traditionally-trained graphic designer. We report on insights generated during this design process and demonstrate the tool's effectiveness via a validation study with synthetic data and feedback from expert musculoskeletal biomechanics researchers who used the tool to analyze the effects of disc degeneration on human spinal kinematics.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346451
Biology and Bioinformatics,VAST,2014,ConTour: Data-Driven Exploration of Multi-Relational Datasets for Drug Discovery,"Large scale data analysis is nowadays a crucial part of drug discovery. Biologists and chemists need to quickly explore and evaluate potentially effective yet safe compounds based on many datasets that are in relationship with each other. However, there is a lack of tools that support them in these processes. To remedy this, we developed ConTour, an interactive visual analytics technique that enables the exploration of these complex, multi-relational datasets. At its core ConTour lists all items of each dataset in a column. Relationships between the columns are revealed through interaction: selecting one or multiple items in one column highlights and re-sorts the items in other columns. Filters based on relationships enable drilling down into the large data space. To identify interesting items in the first place, ConTour employs advanced sorting strategies, including strategies based on connectivity strength and uniqueness, as well as sorting based on item attributes. ConTour also introduces interactive nesting of columns, a powerful method to show the related items of a child column for each item in the parent column. Within the columns, ConTour shows rich attribute data about the items as well as information about the connection strengths to other datasets. Finally, ConTour provides a number of detail views, which can show items from multiple datasets and their associated data at the same time. We demonstrate the utility of our system in case studies conducted with a team of chemical biologists, who investigate the effects of chemical compounds on cells and need to understand the underlying mechanisms.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346752

This paper describes DecisionFlow, a visual analysis technique designed to support the analysis of high-dimensional temporal event sequence data (e.g., thousands of event types). DecisionFlow combines a scalable and dynamic temporal event data structure with interactive multi-view visualizations and ad hoc statistical analytics.

The study results demonstrate that DecisionFlow enables the quick and accurate completion of a range of sequence analysis tasks for datasets containing thousands of event types and millions of individual events.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346682
Biology and Bioinformatics,VAST,2014,Interactive Visual Analysis of Image-Centric Cohort Study Data,"Epidemiological population studies impose information about a set of subjects (a cohort) to characterize disease-specific risk factors. Cohort studies comprise heterogenous variables describing the medical condition as well as demographic and lifestyle factors and, more recently, medical image data. We propose an Interactive Visual Analysis (IVA) approach that enables epidemiologists to rapidly investigate the entire data pool for hypothesis validation and generation. We incorporate image data, which involves shape-based object detection and the derivation of attributes describing the object shape. The concurrent investigation of image-based and non-image data is realized in a web-based multiple coordinated view system, comprising standard views from information visualization and epidemiological data representations such as pivot tables. The views are equipped with brushing facilities and augmented by 3D shape renderings of the segmented objects, e.g., each bar in a histogram is overlaid with a mean shape of the associated subgroup of the cohort. We integrate an overview visualization, clustering of variables and object shape for data-driven subgroup definition and statistical key figures for measuring the association between variables. We demonstrate the IVA approach by validating and generating hypotheses related to lower back pain as part of a qualitative evaluation.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346591
Biology and Bioinformatics,VAST,2014,Progressive Visual Analytics: User-Driven Visual Exploration of In-Progress Analytics,"As datasets grow and analytic algorithms become more complex, the typical workflow of analysts launching an analytic, waiting for it to complete, inspecting the results, and then re-Iaunching the computation with adjusted parameters is not realistic for many real-world tasks. This paper presents an alternative workflow, progressive visual analytics, which enables an analyst to inspect partial results of an algorithm as they become available and interact with the algorithm to prioritize subspaces of interest. Progressive visual analytics depends on adapting analytical algorithms to produce meaningful partial results and enable analyst intervention without sacrificing computational speed. The paradigm also depends on adapting information visualization techniques to incorporate the constantly refining results without overwhelming analysts and provide interactions to support an analyst directing the analytic. The contributions of this paper include: a description of the progressive visual analytics paradigm; design goals for both the algorithms and visualizations in progressive visual analytics systems; an example progressive visual analytics system (Progressive Insights) for analyzing common patterns in a collection of event sequences; and an evaluation of Progressive Insights and the progressive visual analytics paradigm by clinical researchers analyzing electronic medical records.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346574
Biology and Bioinformatics,VAST,2014,An integrated visual analysis system for fusing MR spectroscopy and multi- modal radiology imaging - IEEE Conference Publication,"For cancers such as glioblastoma multiforme, there is an increasing interest in defining \""biological target volumes\"" (BTV), high tumour-burden regions which may be targeted with dose boosts in radiotherapy. The definition of a BTV requires insight into tumour characteristics going beyond conventionally defined radiological abnormalities and anatomical features. Molecular and biochemical imaging techniques, like positron emission tomography, the use of Magnetic Resonance (MR) Imaging contrast agents or MR Spectroscopy deliver this information and support BTV delineation. MR Spectroscopy Imaging (MRSI) is the only non-invasive technique in this list. Studies with MRSI have shown that voxels with certain metabolic signatures are more susceptible to predict the site of relapse. Nevertheless, the discovery of complex relationships between a high number of different metabolites, anatomical, molecular and functional features is an ongoing topic of research - still lacking appropriate tools supporting a smooth workflow by providing data integration and fusion of MRSI data with other imaging modalities. We present a solution bridging this gap which gives fast and flexible access to all data at once. By integrating a customized visualization of the multi-modal and multi-variate image data with a highly flexible visual analytics (VA) framework, it is for the first time possible to interactively fuse, visualize and explore user defined metabolite relations derived from MRSI in combination with markers delivered by other imaging modalities. Real-world medical cases demonstrate the utility of our solution. By making MRSI data available both in a VA tool and in a multi-modal visualization renderer we can combine insights from each side to arrive at a superior BTV delineation. We also report feedback from domain experts indicating significant positive impact in how this work can improve the understanding of MRSI data and its integration into radiotherapy planning.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2014.7042481
Biology and Bioinformatics,InfoVis,2013,Visualization of Shape Motions in Shape Space,"Analysis of dynamic object deformations such as cardiac motion is of great importance, especially when there is a necessity to visualize and compare the deformation behavior across subjects. However, there is a lack of effective techniques for comparative visualization and assessment of a collection of motion data due to its 4-dimensional nature, i.e., timely varying three-dimensional shapes. From the geometric point of view, the motion change can be considered as a function defined on the 2D manifold of the surface. This paper presents a novel classification and visualization method based on a medial surface shape space, in which two novel shape descriptors are defined, for discriminating normal and abnormal human heart deformations as well as localizing the abnormal motion regions. In our medial surface shape space, the geodesic distance connecting two points in the space measures the similarity between their corresponding medial surfaces, which can quantify the similarity and disparity of the 3D heart motions. Furthermore, the novel descriptors can effectively localize the inconsistently deforming myopathic regions on the left ventricle. An easy visualization of heart motion sequences on the projected space allows users to distinguish the deformation differences. Our experimental results on both synthetic and real imaging data show that this method can automatically classify the healthy and myopathic subjects and accurately detect myopathic regions on the left ventricle, which outperforms other conventional cardiac diagnostic methods.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2013.230
Biology and Bioinformatics,VAST,2013,Temporal Event Sequence Simplification,"Electronic Health Records (EHRs) have emerged as a cost-effective data source for conducting medical research. The difficulty in using EHRs for research purposes, however, is that both patient selection and record analysis must be conducted across very large, and typically very noisy datasets. Our previous work introduced EventFlow, a visualization tool that transforms an entire dataset of temporal event records into an aggregated display, allowing researchers to analyze population-level patterns and trends. As datasets become larger and more varied, however, it becomes increasingly difficult to provide a succinct, summarizing display. This paper presents a series of user-driven data simplifications that allow researchers to pare event records down to their core elements. Furthermore, we present a novel metric for measuring visual complexity, and a language for codifying disjoint strategies into an overarching simplification framework. These simplifications were used by real-world researchers to gain new and valuable insights from initially overwhelming datasets.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2013.200
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2013,MObjects--A Novel Method for the Visualization and Interactive Exploration of Defects in Industrial XCT Data,"This paper describes an advanced visualization method for the analysis of defects in industrial 3D X-Ray Computed Tomography (XCT) data. We present a novel way to explore a high number of individual objects in a dataset, e.g., pores, inclusions, particles, fibers, and cracks demonstrated on the special application area of pore extraction in carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP). After calculating the individual object properties volume, dimensions and shape factors, all objects are clustered into a mean object (MObject). The resulting MObject parameter space can be explored interactively. To do so, we introduce the visualization of mean object sets (MObject Sets) in a radial and a parallel arrangement. Each MObject may be split up into sub-classes by selecting a specific property, e.g., volume or shape factor, and the desired number of classes. Applying this interactive selection iteratively leads to the intended classifications and visualizations of MObjects along the selected analysis path. Hereby the given different scaling factors of the MObjects down the analysis path are visualized through a visual linking approach. Furthermore the representative MObjects are exported as volumetric datasets to serve as input for successive calculations and simulations. In the field of porosity determination in CFRP non- destructive testing practitioners use representative MObjects to improve ultrasonic calibration curves. Representative pores also serve as input for heat conduction simulations in active thermography. For a fast overview of the pore properties in a dataset we propose a local MObjects visualization in combination with a color-coded homogeneity visualization of cells. The advantages of our novel approach are demonstrated using real world CFRP specimens. The results were evaluated through a questionnaire in order to determine the practicality of the MObjects visualization as a supportive tool for domain specialists.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2013.177
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2013,Colon Flattening Using Heat Diffusion Riemannian Metric,"We propose a new colon flattening algorithm that is efficient, shape-preserving, and robust to topological noise. Unlike previous approaches, which require a mandatory topological denoising to remove fake handles, our algorithm directly flattens the colon surface without any denoising. In our method, we replace the original Euclidean metric of the colon surface with a heat diffusion metric that is insensitive to topological noise. Using this heat diffusion metric, we then solve a Laplacian equation followed by an integration step to compute the final flattening. We demonstrate that our method is shape-preserving and the shape of the polyps are well preserved. The flattened colon also provides an efficient way to enhance the navigation and inspection in virtual colonoscopy. We further show how the existing colon registration pipeline is made more robust by using our colon flattening. We have tested our method on several colon wall surfaces and the experimental results demonstrate the robustness and the efficiency of our method.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2013.139
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2013,Interactive Patient-Specific Vascular Modeling with Sweep Surfaces,"The precise modeling of vascular structures plays a key role in medical imaging applications, such as diagnosis, therapy planning and blood flow simulations. For the simulation of blood flow in particular, high-precision models are required to produce accurate results. It is thus common practice to perform extensive manual data polishing on vascular segmentations prior to simulation. This usually involves a complex tool chain which is highly impractical for clinical on-site application. To close this gap in current blood flow simulation pipelines, we present a novel technique for interactive vascular modeling which is based on implicit sweep surfaces. Our method is able to generate and correct smooth high-quality models based on geometric centerline descriptions on the fly. It supports complex vascular free-form contours and consequently allows for an accurate and fast modeling of pathological structures such as aneurysms or stenoses. We extend the concept of implicit sweep surfaces to achieve increased robustness and applicability as required in the medical field. We finally compare our method to existing techniques and provide case studies that confirm its contribution to current simulation pipelines.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2013.169
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2013,Semi-Automatic Vortex Extraction in 4D PC-MRI Cardiac Blood Flow Data using Line Predicates,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death worldwide. Their initiation and evolution depends strongly on the blood flow characteristics. In recent years, advances in 4D PC-MRI acquisition enable reliable and time-resolved 3D flow measuring, which allows a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the patient-specific hemodynamics. Currently, medical researchers investigate the relation between characteristic flow patterns like vortices and different pathologies. The manual extraction and evaluation is tedious and requires expert knowledge. Standardized, (semi-)automatic and reliable techniques are necessary to make the analysis of 4D PC-MRI applicable for the clinical routine. In this work, we present an approach for the extraction of vortex flow in the aorta and pulmonary artery incorporating line predicates. We provide an extensive comparison of existent vortex extraction methods to determine the most suitable vortex criterion for cardiac blood flow and apply our approach to ten datasets with different pathologies like coarctations, Tetralogy of Fallot and aneurysms. For two cases we provide a detailed discussion how our results are capable to complement existent diagnosis information. To ensure real-time feedback for the domain experts we implement our method completely on the GPU.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2013.189
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2013,Fast Generation of Virtual X-ray Images for Reconstruction of 3D Anatomy,"We propose a novel GPU-based approach to render virtual X-ray projections of deformable tetrahedral meshes. These meshes represent the shape and the internal density distribution of a particular anatomical structure and are derived from statistical shape and intensity models (SSIMs). We apply our method to improve the geometric reconstruction of 3D anatomy (e.g. pelvic bone) from 2D X-ray images. For that purpose, shape and density of a tetrahedral mesh are varied and virtual X-ray projections are generated within an optimization process until the similarity between the computed virtual X-ray and the respective anatomy depicted in a given clinical X-ray is maximized. The OpenGL implementation presented in this work deforms and projects tetrahedral meshes of high resolution (200.000+ tetrahedra) at interactive rates. It generates virtual X-rays that accurately depict the density distribution of an anatomy of interest. Compared to existing methods that accumulate X-ray attenuation in deformable meshes, our novel approach significantly boosts the deformation/projection performance. The proposed projection algorithm scales better with respect to mesh resolution and complexity of the density distribution, and the combined deformation and projection on the GPU scales better with respect to the number of deformation parameters. The gain in performance allows for a larger number of cycles in the optimization process. Consequently, it reduces the risk of being stuck in a local optimum. We believe that our approach will improve treatments in orthopedics, where 3D anatomical information is essential.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2013.159
Biology and Bioinformatics,InfoVis,2012,"Exploring Flow, Factors, and Outcomes of Temporal Event Sequences with the Outflow Visualization","Event sequence data is common in many domains, ranging from electronic medical records (EMRs) to sports events. Moreover, such sequences often result in measurable outcomes (e.g., life or death, win or loss). Collections of event sequences can be aggregated together to form event progression pathways. These pathways can then be connected with outcomes to model how alternative chains of events may lead to different results. This paper describes the Outflow visualization technique, designed to (1) aggregate multiple event sequences, (2) display the aggregate pathways through different event states with timing and cardinality, (3) summarize the pathways' corresponding outcomes, and (4) allow users to explore external factors that correlate with specific pathway state transitions. Results from a user study with twelve participants show that users were able to learn how to use Outflow easily with limited training and perform a range of tasks both accurately and rapidly.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2012.225
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2012,Automatic Tuning of Spatially Varying Transfer Functions for Blood Vessel Visualization,"Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) is commonly used in clinical routine for diagnosing vascular diseases. The procedure involves the injection of a contrast agent into the blood stream to increase the contrast between the blood vessels and the surrounding tissue in the image data. CTA is often visualized with Direct Volume Rendering (DVR) where the enhanced image contrast is important for the construction of Transfer Functions (TFs). For increased efficiency, clinical routine heavily relies on preset TFs to simplify the creation of such visualizations for a physician. In practice, however, TF presets often do not yield optimal images due to variations in mixture concentration of contrast agent in the blood stream. In this paper we propose an automatic, optimization-based method that shifts TF presets to account for general deviations and local variations of the intensity of contrast enhanced blood vessels. Some of the advantages of this method are the following. It computationally automates large parts of a process that is currently performed manually. It performs the TF shift locally and can thus optimize larger portions of the image than is possible with manual interaction. The method is based on a well known vesselness descriptor in the definition of the optimization criterion. The performance of the method is illustrated by clinically relevant CT angiography datasets displaying both improved structural overviews of vessel trees and improved adaption to local variations of contrast concentration.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2012.203
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2012,Visualization of Flow Behavior in Earth Mantle Convection,"A fundamental characteristic of fluid flow is that it causes mixing: introduce a dye into a flow, and it will disperse. Mixing can be used as a method to visualize and characterize flow. Because mixing is a process that occurs over time, it is a 4D problem that presents a challenge for computation, visualization, and analysis. Motivated by a mixing problem in geophysics, we introduce a combination of methods to analyze, transform, and finally visualize mixing in simulations of convection in a self-gravitating 3D spherical shell representing convection in the Earth's mantle. Geophysicists use tools such as the finite element model CitcomS to simulate convection, and introduce massless, passive tracers to model mixing. The output of geophysical flow simulation is hard to analyze for domain experts because of overall data size and complexity. In addition, information overload and occlusion are problems when visualizing a whole-earth model. To address the large size of the data, we rearrange the simulation data using intelligent indexing for fast file access and efficient caching. To address information overload and interpret mixing, we compute tracer concentration statistics, which are used to characterize mixing in mantle convection models. Our visualization uses a specially tailored version of Direct Volume Rendering. The most important adjustment is the use of constant opacity. Because of this special area of application, i. e. the rendering of a spherical shell, many computations for volume rendering can be optimized. These optimizations are essential to a smooth animation of the time-dependent simulation data. Our results show how our system can be used to quickly assess the simulation output and test hypotheses regarding Earth's mantle convection. The integrated processing pipeline helps geoscientists to focus on their main task of analyzing mantle homogenization.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2012.283
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2012,Automatic Detection and Visualization of Qualitative Hemodynamic Characteristics in Cerebral Aneurysms,"Cerebral aneurysms are a pathological vessel dilatation that bear a high risk of rupture. For the understanding and evaluation of the risk of rupture, the analysis of hemodynamic information plays an important role. Besides quantitative hemodynamic information, also qualitative flow characteristics, e.g., the inflow jet and impingement zone are correlated with the risk of rupture. However, the assessment of these two characteristics is currently based on an interactive visual investigation of the flow field, obtained by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) or blood flow measurements. We present an automatic and robust detection as well as an expressive visualization of these characteristics. The detection can be used to support a comparison, e.g., of simulation results reflecting different treatment options. Our approach utilizes local streamline properties to formalize the inflow jet and impingement zone. We extract a characteristic seeding curve on the ostium, on which an inflow jet boundary contour is constructed. Based on this boundary contour we identify the impingement zone. Furthermore, we present several visualization techniques to depict both characteristics expressively. Thereby, we consider accuracy and robustness of the extracted characteristics, minimal visual clutter and occlusions. An evaluation with six domain experts confirms that our approach detects both hemodynamic characteristics reasonably.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2012.202
Biology and Bioinformatics,InfoVis,2011,Evaluation of Artery Visualizations for Heart Disease Diagnosis,"Heart disease is the number one killer in the United States, and finding indicators of the disease at an early stage is critical for treatment and prevention. In this paper we evaluate visualization techniques that enable the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. A key physical quantity of medical interest is endothelial shear stress (ESS). Low ESS has been associated with sites of lesion formation and rapid progression of disease in the coronary arteries. Having effective visualizations of a patient's ESS data is vital for the quick and thorough non-invasive evaluation by a cardiologist. We present a task taxonomy for hemodynamics based on a formative user study with domain experts. Based on the results of this study we developed HemoVis, an interactive visualization application for heart disease diagnosis that uses a novel 2D tree diagram representation of coronary artery trees. We present the results of a formal quantitative user study with domain experts that evaluates the effect of 2D versus 3D artery representations and of color maps on identifying regions of low ESS. We show statistically significant results demonstrating that our 2D visualizations are more accurate and efficient than 3D representations, and that a perceptually appropriate color map leads to fewer diagnostic mistakes than a rainbow color map.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2011.192
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2011,Context Preserving Maps of Tubular Structures,"When visualizing tubular 3D structures, external representations are often used for guidance and display, and such views in 2D can often contain occlusions. Virtual dissection methods have been proposed where the entire 3D structure can be mapped to the 2D plane, though these will lose context by straightening curved sections. We present a new method of creating maps of 3D tubular structures that yield a succinct view while preserving the overall geometric structure. Given a dominant view plane for the structure, its curve skeleton is first projected to a 2D skeleton. This 2D skeleton is adjusted to account for distortions in length, modified to remove intersections, and optimized to preserve the shape of the original 3D skeleton. Based on this shaped 2D skeleton, a boundary for the map of the object is obtained based on a slicing path through the structure and the radius around the skeleton. The sliced structure is conformally mapped to a rectangle and then deformed via harmonic mapping to match the boundary placement. This flattened map preserves the general geometric context of a 3D object in a 2D display, and rendering of this flattened map can be accomplished using volumetric ray casting. We have evaluated our method on real datasets of human colon models.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2011.182
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2011,GPU-based Real-Time Approximation of the Ablation Zone for Radiofrequency Ablation,"Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is becoming a standard minimally invasive clinical procedure for the treatment of liver tumors. However, planning the applicator placement such that the malignant tissue is completely destroyed, is a demanding task that requires considerable experience. In this work, we present a fast GPU-based real-time approximation of the ablation zone incorporating the cooling effect of liver vessels. Weighted distance fields of varying RF applicator types are derived from complex numerical simulations to allow a fast estimation of the ablation zone. Furthermore, the heat-sink effect of the cooling blood flow close to the applicator's electrode is estimated by means of a preprocessed thermal equilibrium representation of the liver parenchyma and blood vessels. Utilizing the graphics card, the weighted distance field incorporating the cooling blood flow is calculated using a modular shader framework, which facilitates the real-time visualization of the ablation zone in projected slice views and in volume rendering. The proposed methods are integrated in our software assistant prototype for planning RFA therapy. The software allows the physician to interactively place virtual RF applicator models. The real- time visualization of the corresponding approximated ablation zone facilitates interactive evaluation of the tumor coverage in order to optimize the applicator's placement such that all cancer cells are destroyed by the ablation.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2011.207
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2011,Projection-Based Metal-Artifact Reduction for Industrial 3D X-ray Computed Tomography,"Multi-material components, which contain metal parts surrounded by plastic materials, are highly interesting for inspection using industrial 3D X-ray computed tomography (3DXCT). Examples of this application scenario are connectors or housings with metal inlays in the electronic or automotive industry. A major problem of this type of components is the presence of metal, which causes streaking artifacts and distorts the surrounding media in the reconstructed volume. Streaking artifacts and dark- band artifacts around metal components significantly influence the material characterization (especially for the plastic components). In specific cases these artifacts even prevent a further analysis. Due to the nature and the different characteristics of artifacts, the development of an efficient artifact-reduction technique in reconstruction-space is rather complicated. In this paper we present a projection-space pipeline for metal-artifacts reduction. The proposed technique first segments the metal in the spatial domain of the reconstructed volume in order to separate it from the other materials. Then metal parts are forward-projected on the set of projections in a way that metal-projection regions are treated as voids. Subsequently the voids, which are left by the removed metal, are interpolated in the 2D projections. Finally, the metal is inserted back into the reconstructed 3D volume during the fusion stage. We present a visual analysis tool, allowing for interactive parameter estimation of the metal segmentation. The results of the proposed artifact-reduction technique are demonstrated on a test part as well as on real world components. For these specimens we achieve a significant reduction of metal artifacts, allowing an enhanced material characterization.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2011.228
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2011,Multi-Touch Table System for Medical Visualization: Application to Orthopedic Surgery Planning,"Medical imaging plays a central role in a vast range of healthcare practices. The usefulness of 3D visualizations has been demonstrated for many types of treatment planning. Nevertheless, full access to 3D renderings outside of the radiology department is still scarce even for many image-centric specialties. Our work stems from the hypothesis that this under-utilization is partly due to existing visualization systems not taking the prerequisites of this application domain fully into account. We have developed a medical visualization table intended to better fit the clinical reality. The overall design goals were two-fold: similarity to a real physical situation and a very low learning threshold. This paper describes the development of the visualization table with focus on key design decisions. The developed features include two novel interaction components for touch tables. A user study including five orthopedic surgeons demonstrates that the system is appropriate and useful for this application domain.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2011.224
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2011,The FLOWLENS: A Focus-and-Context Visualization Approach for Exploration of Blood Flow in Cerebral Aneurysms,"Blood flow and derived data are essential to investigate the initiation and progression of cerebral aneurysms as well as their risk of rupture. An effective visual exploration of several hemodynamic attributes like the wall shear stress (WSS) and the inflow jet is necessary to understand the hemodynamics. Moreover, the correlation between focus-and- context attributes is of particular interest. An expressive visualization of these attributes and anatomic information requires appropriate visualization techniques to minimize visual clutter and occlusions. We present the FLOWLENS as a focus-and-context approach that addresses these requirements. We group relevant hemodynamic attributes to pairs of focus-and-context attributes and assign them to different anatomic scopes. For each scope, we propose several FLOWLENS visualization templates to provide a flexible visual filtering of the involved hemodynamic pairs. A template consists of the visualization of the focus attribute and the additional depiction of the context attribute inside the lens. Furthermore, the FLOWLENS supports local probing and the exploration of attribute changes over time. The FLOWLENS minimizes visual cluttering, occlusions, and provides a flexible exploration of a region of interest. We have applied our approach to seven representative datasets, including steady and unsteady flow data from CFD simulations and 4D PC-MRI measurements. Informal user interviews with three domain experts confirm the usefulness of our approach.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2011.243
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2011,Distance Visualization for Interactive 3D Implant Planning,"An instant and quantitative assessment of spatial distances between two objects plays an important role in interactive applications such as virtual model assembly, medical operation planning, or computational steering. While some research has been done on the development of distance-based measures between two objects, only very few attempts have been reported to visualize such measures in interactive scenarios. In this paper we present two different approaches for this purpose, and we investigate the effectiveness of these approaches for intuitive 3D implant positioning in a medical operation planning system. The first approach uses cylindrical glyphs to depict distances, which smoothly adapt their shape and color to changing distances when the objects are moved. This approach computes distances directly on the polygonal object representations by means of ray/triangle mesh intersection. The second approach introduces a set of slices as additional geometric structures, and uses color coding on surfaces to indicate distances. This approach obtains distances from a precomputed distance field of each object. The major findings of the performed user study indicate that a visualization that can facilitate an instant and quantitative analysis of distances between two objects in interactive 3D scenarios is demanding, yet can be achieved by including additional monocular cues into the visualization.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2011.189
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2011,Crepuscular Rays for Tumor Accessibility Planning,"In modern clinical practice, planning access paths to volumetric target structures remains one of the most important and most complex tasks, and a physician's insufficient experience in this can lead to severe complications or even the death of the patient. In this paper, we present a method for safety evaluation and the visualization of access paths to assist physicians during preoperative planning. As a metaphor for our method, we employ a well-known, and thus intuitively perceivable, natural phenomenon that is usually called crepuscular rays. Using this metaphor, we propose several ways to compute the safety of paths from the region of interest to all tumor voxels and show how this information can be visualized in real-time using a multi-volume rendering system. Furthermore, we show how to estimate the extent of connected safe areas to improve common medical 2D multi-planar reconstruction (MPR) views. We evaluate our method by means of expert interviews, an online survey, and a retrospective evaluation of 19 real abdominal radio-frequency ablation (RFA) interventions, with expert decisions serving as a gold standard. The evaluation results show clear evidence that our method can be successfully applied in clinical practice without introducing substantial overhead work for the acting personnel. Finally, we show that our method is not limited to medical applications and that it can also be useful in other fields.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2011.184
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2011,Interactive Virtual Probing of 4D MRI Blood-Flow,"Better understanding of hemodynamics conceivably leads to improved diagnosis and prognosis of cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, an elaborate analysis of the blood-flow in heart and thoracic arteries is essential. Contemporary MRI techniques enable acquisition of quantitative time-resolved flow information, resulting in 4D velocity fields that capture the blood-flow behavior. Visual exploration of these fields provides comprehensive insight into the unsteady blood-flow behavior, and precedes a quantitative analysis of additional blood-flow parameters. The complete inspection requires accurate segmentation of anatomical structures, encompassing a time-consuming and hard-to-automate process, especially for malformed morphologies. We present a way to avoid the laborious segmentation process in case of qualitative inspection, by introducing an interactive virtual probe. This probe is positioned semi-automatically within the blood- flow field, and serves as a navigational object for visual exploration. The difficult task of determining position and orientation along the view- direction is automated by a fitting approach, aligning the probe with the orientations of the velocity field. The aligned probe provides an interactive seeding basis for various flow visualization approaches. We demonstrate illustration-inspired particles, integral lines and integral surfaces, conveying distinct characteristics of the unsteady blood-flow. Lastly, we present the results of an evaluation with domain experts, valuing the practical use of our probe and flow visualization techniques.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2011.215
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2010,Exploration of 4D MRI Blood Flow using Stylistic Visualization,"Insight into the dynamics of blood-flow considerably improves the understanding of the complex cardiovascular system and its pathologies. Advances in MRI technology enable acquisition of 4D blood-flow data, providing quantitative blood-flow velocities over time. The currently typical slice-by-slice analysis requires a full mental reconstruction of the unsteady blood-flow field, which is a tedious and highly challenging task, even for skilled physicians. We endeavor to alleviate this task by means of comprehensive visualization and interaction techniques. In this paper we present a framework for pre-clinical cardiovascular research, providing tools to both interactively explore the 4D blood-flow data and depict the essential blood-flow characteristics. The framework encompasses a variety of visualization styles, comprising illustrative techniques as well as improved methods from the established field of flow visualization. Each of the incorporated styles, including exploded planar reformats, flow-direction highlights, and arrow-trails, locally captures the blood-flow dynamics and may be initiated by an interactively probed vessel cross-section. Additionally, we present the results of an evaluation with domain experts, measuring the value of each of the visualization styles and related rendering parameters.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2010.153
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2010,VDVR: Verifiable Volume Visualization of Projection-Based Data,"Practical volume visualization pipelines are never without compromises and errors. A delicate and often-studied component is the interpolation of off-grid samples, where aliasing can lead to misleading artifacts and blurring, potentially hiding fine details of critical importance. The verifiable visualization framework we describe aims to account for these errors directly in the volume generation stage, and we specifically target volumetric data obtained via computed tomography (CT) reconstruction. In this case the raw data are the X-ray projections obtained from the scanner and the volume data generation process is the CT algorithm. Our framework informs the CT reconstruction process of the specific filter intended for interpolation in the subsequent visualization process, and this in turn ensures an accurate interpolation there at a set tolerance. Here, we focus on fast trilinear interpolation in conjunction with an octree-type mixed resolution volume representation without T-junctions. Efficient rendering is achieved by a space-efficient and locality-optimized representation, which can straightforwardly exploit fast fixed-function pipelines on GPUs.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2010.211

The core technique in our system is an algorithm for simulating the tissue vaporization process by laser heating. Different from classical volume CSG operations, our technique takes experimental data as the guidance to determine the vaporization amount so that only a specified amount of tissue is vaporized in each time. Our algorithm uses a predictor-corrector strategy. First, we apply the classical CSG algorithm on a tetrahedral grid based distance field to estimate the vaporized tissue amount. Then, a volume-correction phase is applied on the distance field. To improve the performance, we further propose optimization approaches for efficient implementation.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2010.221

As digital imaging technology advances, high resolution microscopy of large tissue volumes is becoming feasible; however, new interactive tools are needed to explore and analyze the enormous datasets. In this paper we present a visualization framework that specifically targets interactive examination of arbitrarily large image stacks. Our framework is built upon two core techniques: display-aware processing and GPU-accelerated texture compression. With display-aware processing, only the currently visible image tiles are fetched and aligned on-the-fly, reducing memory bandwidth and minimizing the need for time-consuming global pre-processing. Our novel texture compression scheme for GPUs is tailored for quick browsing of image stacks. We evaluate the usability of our viewer for two histology applications: digital pathology and visualization of neural structure at nanoscale-resolution in serial electron micrographs.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2010.168
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2010,Exploration and Visualization of Segmentation Uncertainty using Shape and Appearance Prior Information,We develop an interactive analysis and visualization tool for probabilistic segmentation in medical imaging. The originality of our approach is that the data exploration is guided by shape and appearance knowledge learned from expert-segmented images of a training population. We introduce a set of multidimensional transfer function widgets to analyze the multivariate probabilistic field data. These widgets furnish the user with contextual information about conformance or deviation from the population statistics. We demonstrate the user's ability to identify suspicious regions (e.g. tumors) and to correct the misclassification results. We evaluate our system and demonstrate its usefulness in the context of static anatomical and time- varying functional imaging datasets.,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2010.152
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2010,Supine and Prone Colon Registration Using Quasi-Conformal Mapping,"In virtual colonoscopy, CT scans are typically acquired with the patient in both supine (facing up) and prone (facing down) positions. The registration of these two scans is desirable so that the user can clarify situations or confirm polyp findings at a location in one scan with the same location in the other, thereby improving polyp detection rates and reducing false positives. However, this supine-prone registration is challenging because of the substantial distortions in the colon shape due to the patient's change in position. We present an efficient algorithm and framework for performing this registration through the use of conformal geometry to guarantee that the registration is a diffeomorphism (a one-to-one and onto mapping). The taeniae coli and colon flexures are automatically extracted for each supine and prone surface, employing the colon geometry. The two colon surfaces are then divided into several segments using the flexures, and each segment is cut along a taenia coli and conformally flattened to the rectangular domain using holomorphic differentials. The mean curvature is color encoded as texture images, from which feature points are automatically detected using graph cut segmentation, mathematic morphological operations, and principal component analysis. Corresponding feature points are found between supine and prone and are used to adjust the conformal flattening to be quasi-conformal, such that the features become aligned. We present multiple methods of visualizing our results, including 2D flattened rendering, corresponding 3D endoluminal views, and rendering of distortion measurements. We demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of our registration method by illustrating matched views on both the 2D flattened colon images and in the 3D volume rendered colon endoluminal view. We analytically evaluate the correctness of the results by measuring the distance between features on the registered colons.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2010.200
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2009,Sampling and Visualizing Creases with Scale-Space Particles,"Particle systems have gained importance as a methodology for sampling implicit surfaces and segmented objects to improve mesh generation and shape analysis. We propose that particle systems have a significantly more general role in sampling structure from unsegmented data. We describe a particle system that computes samplings of crease features (i.e. ridges and valleys, as lines or surfaces) that effectively represent many anatomical structures in scanned medical data. Because structure naturally exists at a range of sizes relative to the image resolution, computer vision has developed the theory of scale-space, which considers an n-D image as an (n + 1)-D stack of images at different blurring levels. Our scale-space particles move through continuous four-dimensional scale-space according to spatial constraints imposed by the crease features, a particle-image energy that draws particles towards scales of maximal feature strength, and an inter-particle energy that controls sampling density in space and scale. To make scale-space practical for large three-dimensional data, we present a spline-based interpolation across scale from a small number of pre- computed blurrings at optimally selected scales. The configuration of the particle system is visualized with tensor glyphs that display information about the local Hessian of the image, and the scale of the particle. We use scale-space particles to sample the complex three-dimensional branching structure of airways in lung CT, and the major white matter structures in brain DTI.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2009.177
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2009,Stress Tensor Field Visualization for Implant Planning in Orthopedics,"We demonstrate the application of advanced 3D visualization techniques to determine the optimal implant design and position in hip joint replacement planning. Our methods take as input the physiological stress distribution inside a patient's bone under load and the stress distribution inside this bone under the same load after a simulated replacement surgery. The visualization aims at showing principal stress directions and magnitudes, as well as differences in both distributions. By visualizing changes of normal and shear stresses with respect to the principal stress directions of the physiological state, a comparative analysis of the physiological stress distribution and the stress distribution with implant is provided, and the implant parameters that most closely replicate the physiological stress state in order to avoid stress shielding can be determined. Our method combines volume rendering for the visualization of stress magnitudes with the tracing of short line segments for the visualization of stress directions. To improve depth perception, transparent, shaded, and antialiased lines are rendered in correct visibility order, and they are attenuated by the volume rendering. We use a focus+context approach to visually guide the user to relevant regions in the data, and to support a detailed stress analysis in these regions while preserving spatial context information. Since all of our techniques have been realized on the GPU, they can immediately react to changes in the simulated stress tensor field and thus provide an effective means for optimal implant selection and positioning in a computational steering environment.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2009.184
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2009,"Mapping High-Fidelity Volume Rendering for Medical Imaging to CPU, GPU and Many-Core Architectures","Medical volumetric imaging requires high fidelity, high performance rendering algorithms. We motivate and analyze new volumetric rendering algorithms that are suited to modern parallel processing architectures. First, we describe the three major categories of volume rendering algorithms and confirm through an imaging scientist-guided evaluation that ray-casting is the most acceptable. We describe a thread- and data-parallel implementation of ray-casting that makes it amenable to key architectural trends of three modern commodity parallel architectures: multi-core, GPU, and an upcoming many-core Intelreg architecture code-named Larrabee. We achieve more than an order of magnitude performance improvement on a number of large 3D medical datasets. We further describe a data compression scheme that significantly reduces data-transfer overhead. This allows our approach to scale well to large numbers of Larrabee cores.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2009.164
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2009,Multimodal Vessel Visualization of Mouse Aorta PET/CT Scans,"In this paper, we present a visualization system for the visual analysis of PET/CT scans of aortic arches of mice. The system has been designed in close collaboration between researchers from the areas of visualization and molecular imaging with the objective to get deeper insights into the structural and molecular processes which take place during plaque development. Understanding the development of plaques might lead to a better and earlier diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases, which are still the main cause of death in the western world. After motivating our approach, we will briefly describe the multimodal data acquisition process before explaining the visualization techniques used. The main goal is to develop a system which supports visual comparison of the data of different species. Therefore, we have chosen a linked multi-view approach, which amongst others integrates a specialized straightened multipath curved planar reformation and a multimodal vessel flattening technique. We have applied the visualization concepts to multiple data sets, and we will present the results of this investigation.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2009.169
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2009,BrainGazer - Visual Queries for Neurobiology Research,"Neurobiology investigates how anatomical and physiological relationships in the nervous system mediate behavior. Molecular genetic techniques, applied to species such as the common fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, have proven to be an important tool in this research. Large databases of transgenic specimens are being built and need to be analyzed to establish models of neural information processing. In this paper we present an approach for the exploration and analysis of neural circuits based on such a database. We have designed and implemented \\\emph{BrainGazer}, a system which integrates visualization techniques for volume data acquired through confocal microscopy as well as annotated anatomical structures with an intuitive approach for accessing the available information. We focus on the ability to visually query the data based on semantic as well as spatial relationships. Additionally, we present visualization techniques for the concurrent depiction of neurobiological volume data and geometric objects which aim to reduce visual clutter. The described system is the result of an ongoing interdisciplinary collaboration between neurobiologists and visualization researchers.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2009.121
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2009,Volume Illustration of Muscle from Diffusion Tensor Images,"Medical illustration has demonstrated its effectiveness to depict salient anatomical features while hiding the irrelevant details. Current solutions are ineffective for visualizing fibrous structures such as muscle, because typical datasets (CT or MRI) do not contain directional details. In this paper, we introduce a new muscle illustration approach that leverages diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data and example-based texture synthesis techniques. Beginning with a volumetric diffusion tensor image, we reformulate it into a scalar field and an auxiliary guidance vector field to represent the structure and orientation of a muscle bundle. A muscle mask derived from the input diffusion tensor image is used to classify the muscle structure. The guidance vector field is further refined to remove noise and clarify structure. To simulate the internal appearance of the muscle, we propose a new two-dimensional example based solid texture synthesis algorithm that builds a solid texture constrained by the guidance vector field. Illustrating the constructed scalar field and solid texture efficiently highlights the global appearance of the muscle as well as the local shape and structure of the muscle fibers in an illustrative fashion. We have applied the proposed approach to five example datasets (four pig hearts and a pig leg), demonstrating plausible illustration and expressiveness.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2009.203
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2008,Visualizing Particle/Flow Structure Interactions in the Small Bronchial Tubes,"Particle deposition in the small bronchial tubes (generations six through twelve) is strongly influenced by the vortex- dominated secondary flows that are induced by axial curvature of the tubes. In this paper, we employ particle destination maps in conjunction with two- dimensional, finite-time Lyapunov exponent maps to illustrate how the trajectories of finite-mass particles are influenced by the presence of vortices. We consider two three-generation bronchial tube models: a planar, asymmetric geometry and a non-planar, asymmetric geometry. Our visualizations demonstrate that these techniques, coupled with judiciously seeded particle trajectories, are effective tools for studying particle/flow structure interactions.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2008.183
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2008,Visualization of Cellular and Microvascular Relationships,"Understanding the structure of microvasculature structures and their relationship to cells in biological tissue is an important and complex problem. Brain microvasculature in particular is known to play an important role in chronic diseases. However, these networks are only visible at the microscopic level and can span large volumes of tissue. Due to recent advances in microscopy, large volumes of data can be imaged at the resolution necessary to reconstruct these structures. Due to the dense and complex nature of microscopy data sets, it is important to limit the amount of information displayed. In this paper, we describe methods for encoding the unique structure of microvascular data, allowing researchers to selectively explore microvascular anatomy. We also identify the queries most useful to researchers studying microvascular and cellular relationships. By associating cellular structures with our microvascular framework, we allow researchers to explore interesting anatomical relationships in dense and complex data sets.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2008.179
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2008,Texture-based Transfer Functions for Direct Volume Rendering,"Visualization of volumetric data faces the difficult task of finding effective parameters for the transfer functions. Those parameters can determine the effectiveness and accuracy of the visualization. Frequently, volumetric data includes multiple structures and features that need to be differentiated. However, if those features have the same intensity and gradient values, existing transfer functions are limited at effectively illustrating those similar features with different rendering properties. We introduce texture-based transfer functions for direct volume rendering. In our approach, the voxelpsilas resulting opacity and color are based on local textural properties rather than individual intensity values. For example, if the intensity values of the vessels are similar to those on the boundary of the lungs, our texture-based transfer function will analyze the textural properties in those regions and color them differently even though they have the same intensity values in the volume. The use of texture-based transfer functions has several benefits. First, structures and features with the same intensity and gradient values can be automatically visualized with different rendering properties. Second, segmentation or prior knowledge of the specific features within the volume is not required for classifying these features differently. Third, textural metrics can be combined and/or maximized to capture and better differentiate similar structures. We demonstrate our texture-based transfer function for direct volume rendering with synthetic and real-world medical data to show the strength of our technique.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2008.169
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2008,Effective visualization of complex vascular structures using a non-parametric vessel detection method,"The effective visualization of vascular structures is critical for diagnosis, surgical planning as well as treatment evaluation. In recent work, we have developed an algorithm for vessel detection that examines the intensity profile around each voxel in an angiographic image and determines the likelihood that any given voxel belongs to a vessel; we term this the \""vesselness coefficient\"" of the voxel. Our results show that our algorithm works particularly well for visualizing branch points in vessels. Compared to standard Hessian based techniques, which are fine-tuned to identify long cylindrical structures, our technique identifies branches and connections with other vessels. Using our computed vesselness coefficient, we explore a set of techniques for visualizing vasculature. Visualizing vessels is particularly challenging because not only is their position in space important for clinicians but it is also important to be able to resolve their spatial relationship. We applied visualization techniques that provide shape cues as well as depth cues to allow the viewer to differentiate between vessels that are closer from those that are farther. We use our computed vesselness coefficient to effectively visualize vasculature in both clinical neurovascular x-ray computed tomography based angiography images, as well as images from three different animal studies. We conducted a formal user evaluation of our visualization techniques with the help of radiologists, surgeons, and other expert users. Results indicate that experts preferred distance color blending and tone shading for conveying depth over standard visualization techniques.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2008.123
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2008,Visualization of Myocardial Perfusion Derived from Coronary Anatomy,"Visually assessing the effect of the coronary artery anatomy on the perfusion of the heart muscle in patients with coronary artery disease remains a challenging task. We explore the feasibility of visualizing this effect on perfusion using a numerical approach. We perform a computational simulation of the way blood is perfused throughout the myocardium purely based on information from a three-dimensional anatomical tomographic scan. The results are subsequently visualized using both three-dimensional visualizations and bullpsilas eye plots, partially inspired by approaches currently common in medical practice. Our approach results in a comprehensive visualization of the coronary anatomy that compares well to visualizations commonly used for other scanning technologies. We demonstrate techniques giving detailed insight in blood supply, coronary territories and feeding coronary arteries of a selected region. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach through visualizations that show information which commonly cannot be directly observed in scanning data, such as a separate visualization of the supply from each coronary artery. We thus show that the results of a computational simulation can be effectively visualized and facilitate visually correlating these results to for example perfusion data.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2008.180
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2008,Interactive Blood Damage Analysis for Ventricular Assist Devices,"Ventricular Assist Devices (VADs) support the heart in its vital task of maintaining circulation in the human body when the heart alone is not able to maintain a sufficient flow rate due to illness or degenerative diseases. However, the engineering of these devices is a highly demanding task. Advanced modeling methods and computer simulations allow the investigation of the fluid flow inside such a device and in particular of potential blood damage. In this paper we present a set of visualization methods which have been designed to specifically support the analysis of a tensor-based blood damage prediction model. This model is based on the tracing of particles through the VAD, for each of which the cumulative blood damage can be computed. The model's tensor output approximates a single blood cell's deformation in the flow field. The tensor and derived scalar data are subsequently visualized using techniques based on icons, particle visualization, and function plotting. All these techniques are accessible through a Virtual Reality-based user interface, which features not only stereoscopic rendering but also natural interaction with the complex three-dimensional data. To illustrate the effectiveness of these visualization methods, we present the results of an analysis session that was performed by domain experts for a specific data set for the MicroMed DeBakey VAD.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2008.142
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2008,Glyph-Based SPECT Visualization for the Diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease,"Myocardial perfusion imaging with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is an established method for the detection and evaluation of coronary artery disease (CAD). State-of-the-art SPECT scanners yield a large number of regional parameters of the left- ventricular myocardium (e.g., blood supply at rest and during stress, wall thickness, and wall thickening during heart contraction) that all need to be assessed by the physician. Today, the individual parameters of this multivariate data set are displayed as stacks of 2D slices, bull's eye plots, or, more recently, surfaces in 3D, which depict the left-ventricular wall. In all these visualizations, the data sets are displayed side-by-side rather than in an integrated manner, such that the multivariate data have to be examined sequentially and need to be fused mentally. This is time consuming and error- prone. In this paper we present an interactive 3D glyph visualization, which enables an effective integrated visualization of the multivariate data. Results from semiotic theory are used to optimize the mapping of different variables to glyph properties. This facilitates an improved perception of important information and thus an accelerated diagnosis. The 3D glyphs are linked to the established 2D views, which permit a more detailed inspection, and to relevant meta-information such as known stenoses of coronary vessels supplying the myocardial region. Our method has demonstrated its potential for clinical routine use in real application scenarios assessed by nuclear physicians.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2008.136
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2008,Sinus Endoscopy - Application of Advanced GPU Volume Rendering for Virtual Endoscopy,"For difficult cases in endoscopic sinus surgery, a careful planning of the intervention is necessary. Due to the reduced field of view during the intervention, the surgeons have less information about the surrounding structures in the working area compared to open surgery. Virtual endoscopy enables the visualization of the operating field and additional information, such as risk structures (e.g., optical nerve and skull base) and target structures to be removed (e.g., mucosal swelling). The Sinus Endoscopy system provides the functional range of a virtual endoscopic system with special focus on a realistic representation. Furthermore, by using direct volume rendering, we avoid time-consuming segmentation steps for the use of individual patient datasets. However, the image quality of the endoscopic view can be adjusted in a way that a standard computer with a modern standard graphics card achieves interactive frame rates with low CPU utilization. Thereby, characteristics of the endoscopic view are systematically used for the optimization of the volume rendering speed. The system design was based on a careful analysis of the endoscopic sinus surgery and the resulting needs for computer support. As a small standalone application it can be instantly used for surgical planning and patient education. First results of a clinical evaluation with ENT surgeons were employed to fine-tune the user interface, in particular to reduce the number of controls by using appropriate default values wherever possible. The system was used for preoperative planning in 102 cases, provides useful information for intervention planning (e.g., anatomic variations of the Rec. Frontalis), and closely resembles the intraoperative situation.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2008.161
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2007,Stochastic DT-MRI Connectivity Mapping on the GPU,"We present a method for stochastic fiber tract mapping from diffusion tensor MRI (DT-MRI) implemented on graphics hardware. From the simulated fibers we compute a connectivity map that gives an indication of the probability that two points in the dataset are connected by a neuronal fiber path. A Bayesian formulation of the fiber model is given and it is shown that the inversion method can be used to construct plausible connectivity. An implementation of this fiber model on the graphics processing unit (GPU) is presented. Since the fiber paths can be stochastically generated independently of one another, the algorithm is highly parallelizable. This allows us to exploit the data-parallel nature of the GPU fragment processors. We also present a framework for the connectivity computation on the GPU. Our implementation allows the user to interactively select regions of interest and observe the evolving connectivity results during computation. Results are presented from the stochastic generation of over 250,000 fiber steps per iteration at interactive frame rates on consumer-grade graphics hardware.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2007.70597
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2007,Segmentation of Three-dimensional Retinal Image Data,"We have combined methods from volume visualization and data analysis to support better diagnosis and treatment of human retinal diseases. Many diseases can be identified by abnormalities in the thicknesses of various retinal layers captured using optical coherence tomography (OCT). We used a support vector machine (SVM) to perform semi-automatic segmentation of retinal layers for subsequent analysis including a comparison of layer thicknesses to known healthy parameters. We have extended and generalized an older SVM approach to support better performance in a clinical setting through performance enhancements and graceful handling of inherent noise in OCT data by considering statistical characteristics at multiple levels of resolution. The addition of the multi- resolution hierarchy extends the SVM to have \""global awareness\"". A feature, such as a retinal layer, can therefore be modeled within the SVM as a combination of statistical characteristics across all levels; thus capturing high- and low-frequency information. We have compared our semi-automatically generated segmentations to manually segmented layers for verification purposes. Our main goals were to provide a tool that could (i) be used in a clinical setting; (ii) operate on noisy OCT data; and (iii) isolate individual or multiple retinal layers in both healthy and disease cases that contain structural deformities.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2007.70590
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2007,High-Quality Multimodal Volume Rendering for Preoperative Planning of Neurosurgical Interventions,"Surgical approaches tailored to an individual patient's anatomy and pathology have become standard in neurosurgery. Precise preoperative planning of these procedures, however, is necessary to achieve an optimal therapeutic effect. Therefore, multiple radiological imaging modalities are used prior to surgery to delineate the patient's anatomy, neurological function, and metabolic processes. Developing a three-dimensional perception of the surgical approach, however, is traditionally still done by mentally fusing multiple modalities. Concurrent 3D visualization of these datasets can, therefore, improve the planning process significantly. In this paper we introduce an application for planning of individual neurosurgical approaches with high-quality interactive multimodal volume rendering. The application consists of three main modules which allow to (1) plan the optimal skin incision and opening of the skull tailored to the underlying pathology; (2) visualize superficial brain anatomy, function and metabolism; and (3) plan the patient-specific approach for surgery of deep-seated lesions. The visualization is based on direct multi-volume raycasting on graphics hardware, where multiple volumes from different modalities can be displayed concurrently at interactive frame rates. Graphics memory limitations are avoided by performing raycasting on bricked volumes. For preprocessing tasks such as registration or segmentation, the visualization modules are integrated into a larger framework, thus supporting the entire workflow of preoperative planning.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2007.70560
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2007,Uncertainty Visualization in Medical Volume Rendering Using Probabilistic Animation,"Direct volume rendering has proved to be an effective visualization method for medical data sets and has reached wide-spread clinical use. The diagnostic exploration, in essence, corresponds to a tissue classification task, which is often complex and time-consuming. Moreover, a major problem is the lack of information on the uncertainty of the classification, which can have dramatic consequences for the diagnosis. In this paper this problem is addressed by proposing animation methods to convey uncertainty in the rendering. The foundation is a probabilistic Transfer Function model which allows for direct user interaction with the classification. The rendering is animated by sampling the probability domain over time, which results in varying appearance for uncertain regions. A particularly promising application of this technique is a \""sensitivity lens\"" applied to focus regions in the data set. The methods have been evaluated by radiologists in a study simulating the clinical task of stenosis assessment, in which the animation technique is shown to outperform traditional rendering in terms of assessment accuracy.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2007.70518
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2007,CoViCAD: Comprehensive Visualization of Coronary Artery Disease,"We present novel, comprehensive visualization techniques for the diagnosis of patients with coronary artery disease using segmented cardiac MRI data. We extent an accepted medical visualization technique called the bull's eye plot by removing discontinuities, preserving the volumetric nature of the left ventricular wall and adding anatomical context. The resulting volumetric bull's eye plot can be used for the assessment of transmurality. We link these visualizations to a 3D view that presents viability information in a detailed anatomical context. We combine multiple MRI scans (whole heart anatomical data, late enhancement data) and multiple segmentations (polygonal heart model, late enhancement contours, coronary artery tree). By selectively combining different rendering techniques we obtain comprehensive yet intuitive visualizations of the various data sources.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2007.70550
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2007,LiveSync: Deformed Viewing Spheres for Knowledge-Based Navigation,"Although real-time interactive volume rendering is available even for very large data sets, this visualization method is used quite rarely in the clinical practice. We suspect this is because it is very complicated and time consuming to adjust the parameters to achieve meaningful results. The clinician has to take care of the appropriate viewpoint, zooming, transfer function setup, clipping planes and other parameters. Because of this, most often only 2D slices of the data set are examined. Our work introduces LiveSync, a new concept to synchronize 2D slice views and volumetric views of medical data sets. Through intuitive picking actions on the slice, the users define the anatomical structures they are interested in. The 3D volumetric view is updated automatically with the goal that the users are provided with expressive result images. To achieve this live synchronization we use a minimal set of derived information without the need for segmented data sets or data-specific pre- computations. The components we consider are the picked point, slice view zoom, patient orientation, viewpoint history, local object shape and visibility. We introduce deformed viewing spheres which encode the viewpoint quality for the components. A combination of these deformed viewing spheres is used to estimate a good viewpoint. Our system provides the physician with synchronized views which help to gain deeper insight into the medical data with minimal user interaction.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2007.70576
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2007,Surface Extraction from Multi-Material Components for Metrology using Dual Energy CT,"This paper describes a novel method for creating surface models of multi-material components using dual energy computed tomography (DECT). The application scenario is metrology and dimensional measurement in industrial high resolution 3D X-ray computed tomography (3DCT). Based on the dual source / dual exposure technology this method employs 3DCT scans of a high precision micro-focus and a high energy macro-focus X-ray source. The presented work makes use of the advantages of dual X-ray exposure technology in order to facilitate dimensional measurements of multi-material components with high density material within low density material. We propose a workflow which uses image fusion and local surface extraction techniques: a prefiltering step reduces noise inherent in the data. For image fusion the datasets have to be registered. In the fusion step the benefits of both scans are combined. The structure of the specimen is taken from the low precision, blurry, high energy dataset while the sharp edges are adopted and fused into the resulting image from the high precision, crisp, low energy dataset. In the final step a reliable surface model is extracted from the fused dataset using a local adaptive technique. The major contribution of this paper is the development of a specific workflow for dimensional measurements of multi-material industrial components, which takes two X-ray CT datasets with complementary strengths and weaknesses into account. The performance of the workflow is discussed using a test specimen as well as two real world industrial parts. As result, a significant improvement in overall measurement precision, surface geometry and mean deviation to reference measurement compared to single exposure scans was facilitated.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2007.70598
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2006,Visualization and Analysis of Large Data Collections: a Case Study Applied to Confocal Microscopy Data,"In this paper we propose an approach in which interactive visualization and analysis are combined with batch tools for the processing of large data collections. Large and heterogeneous data collections are difficult to analyze and pose specific problems to interactive visualization. Application of the traditional interactive processing and visualization approaches as well as batch processing encounter considerable drawbacks for such large and heterogeneous data collections due to the amount and type of data. Computing resources are not sufficient for interactive exploration of the data and automated analysis has the disadvantage that the user has only limited control and feedback on the analysis process. In our approach, an analysis procedure with features and attributes of interest for the analysis is defined interactively. This procedure is used for offline processing of large collections of data sets. The results of the batch process along with \""visual summaries\"" are used for further analysis. Visualization is not only used for the presentation of the result, but also as a tool to monitor the validity and quality of the operations performed during the batch process. Operations such as feature extraction and attribute calculation of the collected data sets are validated by visual inspection. This approach is illustrated by an extensive case study, in which a collection of confocal microscopy data sets is analyzed",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2006.195
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2006,Enhancing Depth Perception in Translucent Volumes,"We present empirical studies that consider the effects of stereopsis and simulated aerial perspective on depth perception in translucent volumes. We consider a purely absorptive lighting model, in which light is not scattered or reflected, but is simply absorbed as it passes through the volume. A purely absorptive lighting model is used, for example, when rendering digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs), which are synthetic X-ray images reconstructed from CT volumes. Surgeons make use of DRRs in planning and performing operations, so an improvement of depth perception in DRRs may help diagnosis and surgical planning",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2006.139
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2006,Lines of Curvature for Polyp Detection in Virtual Colonoscopy,"Computer- aided diagnosis (CAD) is a helpful addition to laborious visual inspection for preselection of suspected colonic polyps in virtual colonoscopy. Most of the previous work on automatic polyp detection makes use of indicators based on the scalar curvature of the colon wall and can result in many false-positive detections. Our work tries to reduce the number of false-positive detections in the preselection of polyp candidates. Polyp surface shape can be characterized and visualized using lines of curvature. In this paper, we describe techniques for generating and rendering lines of curvature on surfaces and we show that these lines can be used as part of a polyp detection approach. We have adapted existing approaches on explicit triangular surface meshes, and developed a new algorithm on implicit surfaces embedded in 3D volume data. The visualization of shaded colonic surfaces can be enhanced by rendering the derived lines of curvature on these surfaces. Features strongly correlated with true-positive detections were calculated on lines of curvature and used for the polyp candidate selection. We studied the performance of these features on 5 data sets that included 331 pre-detected candidates, of which 50 sites were true polyps. The winding angle had a significant discriminating power for true-positive detections, which was demonstrated by a Wilcoxon rank sum test with p<0.001. The median winding angle and inter- quartile range (IQR) for true polyps were 7.817 and 6.770-9.288 compared to 2.954 and 1.995-3.749 for false-positive detections",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2006.158
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2006,Real-Time Illustration of Vascular Structures,"We present real-time vascular visualization methods, which extend on illustrative rendering techniques to particularly accentuate spatial depth and to improve the perceptive separation of important vascular properties such as branching level and supply area. The resulting visualization can and has already been used for direct projection on a patient's organ in the operation theater where the varying absorption and reflection characteristics of the surface limit the use of color. The important contributions of our work are a GPU-based hatching algorithm for complex tubular structures that emphasizes shape and depth as well as GPU- accelerated shadow-like depth indicators, which enable reliable comparisons of depth distances in a static monoscopic 3D visualization. In addition, we verify the expressiveness of our illustration methods in a large, quantitative study with 160 subjects",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2006.172

The procedure is described using examples from forensic medicine and the added value and future potential of virtual autopsies is shown from a medical and forensic perspective. Based on the technical demands of the procedure state-of-the-art volume rendering techniques are applied and refined to enable real-time, full body virtual autopsies involving gigabyte sized data on standard GPUs. The techniques applied include transfer function based data reduction using level-of-detail selection and multi-resolution rendering techniques. The paper also describes a data management component for large, out-of-core data sets and an extension to the GPU-based raycaster for efficient dual TF rendering.

Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2006,A Pipeline for Computer Aided Polyp Detection,"We present a novel pipeline for computer- aided detection (CAD) of colonic polyps by integrating texture and shape analysis with volume rendering and conformal colon flattening. Using our automatic method, the 3D polyp detection problem is converted into a 2D pattern recognition problem. The colon surface is first segmented and extracted from the CT data set of the patient's abdomen, which is then mapped to a 2D rectangle using conformal mapping. This flattened image is rendered using a direct volume rendering technique with a translucent electronic biopsy transfer function. The polyps are detected by a 2D clustering method on the flattened image. The false positives are further reduced by analyzing the volumetric shape and texture features. Compared with shape based methods, our method is much more efficient without the need of computing curvature and other shape parameters for the whole colon surface. The final detection results are stored in the 2D image, which can be easily incorporated into a virtual colonoscopy (VC) system to highlight the polyp locations. The extracted colon surface mesh can be used to accelerate the volumetric ray casting algorithm used to generate the VC endoscopic view. The proposed automatic CAD pipeline is incorporated into an interactive VC system, with a goal of helping radiologists detect polyps faster and with higher accuracy",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2006.112
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2005,Profile Flags: a novel metaphor for probing of T/sub 2/ maps - IEEE Conference Publication,"This paper describes a tool for the visualization of T/sub 2/ maps of knee cartilage. Given the anatomical scan, and the T/sub 2/ map of the cartilage, we combine the information on the shape and the quality of the cartilage in a single image. The Profile Flag is an intuitive 3D glyph for probing and annotating of the underlying data. It comprises a bulletin board pin-like shape with a small flag on top of it. While moving the glyph along the reconstructed surface of an object, the curve data measured along the pin's needle and in its neighborhood are shown on the flag. The application area of the Profile Flag is manifold, enabling the visualization of profile data of dense but in- homogeneous objects. Furthermore, it extracts the essential part of the data without removing or even reducing the context information. By sticking Profile Flags into the investigated structure, one or more significant locations can be annotated by showing the local characteristics of the data at that locations. In this paper we are demonstrating the properties of the tool by visualizing T/sub 2/ maps of knee cartilage.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2005.1532847
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2005,Rendering tetrahedral meshes with higher-order attenuation functions for digital radiograph reconstruction - IEEE Conference Publication,"This paper presents a novel method for computing simulated x-ray images, or DRRs (digitally reconstructed radiographs), of tetrahedral meshes with higher-order attenuation functions. DRRs are commonly used in computer assisted surgery (CAS), with the attenuation function consisting of a voxelized CT study, which is viewed from different directions. Our application of DRRs is in intra-operative \""2D-3D\"" registration, i.e., finding the pose of the CT dataset given a small number of patient radiographs. We register 2D patient images with a statistical tetrahedral model, which encodes the CT intensity numbers as Bernstein polynomials, and includes knowledge about typical shape variation modes. The unstructured grid is more suitable for applying deformations than a rectilinear grid, and the higher-order polynomials provide a better approximation of the actual density than constant or linear models. The infra-operative environment demands a fast method for creating the DRRs, which we present here. We demonstrate this application through the creation and use of a deformable atlas of human pelvis bones. Compared with other works on rendering unstructured grids, the main contributions of this work are: 1) Simple and perspective-correct interpolation of the thickness of a tetrahedral cell. 2) Simple and perspective-correct interpolation of front and back barycentric coordinates with respect to the cell. 3) Computing line integrals of higher-order functions. 4) Capability of applying shape deformations and variations in the attenuation function without significant performance loss. The method does not depend on for pre-integration, and does not require depth-sorting of the visualized cells. We present imaging and timing results of implementing the algorithm, and discuss the impact of using higher-order functions on the quality of the result and the performance.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2005.1532809
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2005,Teniae coli guided navigation and registration for virtual colonoscopy - IEEE Conference Publication,"We present a new method for guiding virtual colonoscopic navigation and registration by using teniae coli as anatomical landmarks. As most existing protocols require a patient to be scanned in both supine and prone positions to increase sensitivity in detecting colonic polyps, reference and registration between scans are necessary. However, the conventional centerline approach, generating only the longitudinal distance along the colon, lacks the necessary orientation information to synchronize the virtual navigation cameras in both scanned positions. In this paper we describe a semi-automatic method to detect teniae coli from a colonic surface model reconstructed from CT colonography. Teniae coli are three bands of longitudinal smooth muscle on the surface of the colon. They form a triple helix structure from the appendix to the sigmoid colon and are ideal references for virtual navigation. Our method was applied to 3 patients resulting in 6 data sets (supine and prone scans). The detected teniae coli matched well with our visual inspection. In addition, we demonstrate that polyps visible on both scans can be located and matched more efficiently with the aid of a teniae coli guided navigation implementation.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2005.1532806

For about half a million particles, reconstruction of diffusion directions from the tensor field, time integration and rendering can be done at interactive rates. Different visualization options like oriented particles of diffusion- dependent shape, stream lines or stream tubes facilitate the use of particle tracing for diffusion tensor visualization. The proposed methods provide efficient and intuitive means to show the dynamics in diffusion tensor fields, and they accommodate the exploration of the diffusion properties of biological tissue.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2005.1532780

Especially, they are used to describe charge, mass and energy transport (i.e. electrical conductivity tensor, diffusion tensor, thermal conduction tensor resp.) If the locale transport pattern is complicated, usual second order tensor representation is not sufficient. So far, there are no appropriate visualization methods for this case. We point out similarities of symmetric higher order tensors and spherical harmonics. A spherical harmonic representation is used to improve tensor glyphs. This paper unites the definition of streamlines and tensor lines and generalizes tensor lines to those applications where second order tensors representations fail. The algorithm is tested on the tractography problem in diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI) and improved for this special application.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2005.1532773
Biology and Bioinformatics,InfoVis,2004,Matrix Zoom: A Visual Interface to Semi-External Graphs - IEEE Conference Publication,"In Web data, telecommunications traffic and in epidemiological studies, dense subgraphs correspond to subsets of subjects (i.e. users, patients) that share a collection of attributes values (i.e. accessed Web pages, email-calling patterns or disease diagnostic profiles). Visual and computational identification of these \""clusters\"" becomes useful when domain experts desire to determine those factors of major influence in the formation of access and communication clusters or in the detection and contention of disease spread. With the current increases in graphic hardware capabilities and RAM sizes, it is more useful to relate graph sizes to the available screen real estate S and the amount of available RAM M, instead of the number of edges or nodes in the graph. We offer a visual interface that is parameterized by M and S and is particularly suited for navigation tasks that require the identification of subgraphs whose edge density is above certain threshold. This is achieved by providing a zoomable matrix view of the underlying data. This view is strongly coupled to a hierarchical view of the essential information elements present in the data domain. We illustrate the applicability of this work to the visual navigation of cancer incidence data and to an aggregated sample of phone call traffic",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/INFVIS.2004.46
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2004,Non-linear model fitting to parameterize diseased blood vessels - IEEE Conference Publication,"Accurate estimation of vessel parameters is a prerequisite for automated visualization and analysis of healthy and diseased blood vessels. The objective of this research is to estimate the dimensions of lower extremity arteries, imaged by computed tomography (CT). These parameters are required to get a good quality visualization of healthy as well as diseased arteries using a visualization technique such as curved planar reformation (CPR). The vessel is modeled using an elliptical or cylindrical structure with specific dimensions, orientation and blood vessel mean density. The model separates two homogeneous regions: its inner side represents a region of density for vessels, and its outer side a region for background. Taking into account the point spread function (PSF) of a CT scanner, a function is modeled with a Gaussian kernel, in order to smooth the vessel boundary in the model. A new strategy for vessel parameter estimation is presented. It stems from vessel model and model parameter optimization by a nonlinear optimization procedure, i.e., the Levenberg- Marquardt technique. The method provides center location, diameter and orientation of the vessel as well as blood and background mean density values. The method is tested on synthetic data and real patient data with encouraging results.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2004.72
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2004,The VesselGlyph: focus & context visualization in CT-angiography - IEEE Conference Publication,"Accurate and reliable visualization of blood vessels is still a challenging problem, notably in the presence of morphologic changes resulting from atherosclerotic diseases. We take advantage of partially segmented data with approximately identified vessel centerlines to comprehensively visualize the diseased peripheral arterial tree. We introduce the VesselGlyph as an abstract notation for novel focus & context visualization techniques of tubular structures such as contrast-medium enhanced arteries in CT-angiography (CTA). The proposed techniques combine direct volume rendering (DVR) and curved planar reformation (CPR) within a single image. The VesselGlyph consists of several regions where different rendering methods are used. The region type, the used visualization method and the region parameters depend on the distance from the vessel centerline and on viewing parameters as well. By selecting proper rendering techniques for different regions, vessels are depicted in a naturally looking and undistorted anatomic context. This may facilitate the diagnosis and treatment planning of patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease. In this paper we furthermore present a way of how to implement the proposed techniques in software and by means of modern 3D graphics accelerators.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2004.104
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2004,Interactive thickness visualization of articular cartilage - IEEE Conference Publication,"This work describes a method to visualize the thickness of curved thin objects. Given the MRI volume data of articular cartilage, medical doctors investigate pathological changes of the thickness. Since the tissue is very thin, it is impossible to reliably map the thickness information by direct volume rendering. Our idea is based on unfolding of such structures preserving their thickness. This allows to perform anisotropic geometrical operations (e.g., scaling the thickness). However, flattening of a curved structure implies a distortion of its surface. The distortion problem is alleviated through a focus-and-context minimization approach. Distortion is smallest close to a focal point which can be interactively selected by the user.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2004.56

This work introduces STEPS, a virtual endoscopy system designed to aid surgeons in getting acquainted with the endoscopic view, the handling of instruments, the transsphenoidal approach and challenges associated with the procedure. STEPS also assists experienced surgeons in planning a real endoscopic intervention by getting familiar with the individual patient anatomy, identifying landmarks, planning the approach and deciding upon the ideal target position of the actual surgical activity.

We have found that using our data structure in combination with point-based techniques, implemented on graphics hardware, effects in real-time rendering and exploration. Our extraction algorithm utilizes an incremental and progressive update scheme, enabling smooth interaction without significant latency. Moreover, the corresponding visualization pipeline is capable of processing large data sets by utilizing all three levels of memory: disk, system and graphics.

Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2003,Advanced curved planar reformation: flattening of vascular structures - IEEE Conference Publication,"Traditional volume visualization techniques may provide incomplete clinical information needed for applications in medical visualization. In the area of vascular visualization important features such as the lumen of a diseased vessel segment may not be visible. Curved planar reformation (CPR) has proven to be an acceptable practical solution. Existing CPR techniques, however, still have diagnostically relevant limitations. In this paper, we introduce two advances methods for efficient vessel visualization, based on the concept of CPR. Both methods benefit from relaxation of spatial coherence in favor of improved feature perception. We present a new technique to visualize the interior of a vessel in a single image. A vessel is resampled along a spiral around its central axis. The helical spiral depicts the vessel volume. Furthermore, a method to display an entire vascular tree without mutually occluding vessels is presented. Minimal rotations at the bifurcations avoid occlusions.

Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2003,Psychophysical scaling of a cardiovascular information display - IEEE Conference Publication,"A new method was developed to increase the saliency of changing variables in a cardiovascular visualization for use by anesthesiologists in the operating room (OR). Clinically meaningful changes in patient physiology were identified and then mapped to the inherent psychophysical properties of the visualization. A long history of psychophysical research has provided an understanding of the parameters within which the human information processing system is able to detect changes in the size, shape and color of visual objects (Gescheider, 1976, Spence, 1990, and Baird, 1970). These detection thresholds are known as just noticeable differences (JNDs) which characterize the amount of change in an object's attribute that is recognizable 50% of the time. A prototype version of the display has been demonstrated to facilitate anesthesiologist's performance while reducing cognitive workload during simulated cardiac events (Agutter et al., 2002). In order to further improve the utility of the new cardiovascular visualization, the clinically relevant changes in cardiovascular variables are mapped to noticeable perceptual changes in the representational elements of the display. The results of the method described in this paper are used to merge information from the psychophysical properties of the cardiovascular visualization, with clinically relevant changes in the patient's cardiovascular physiology as measured by the clinical meaningfulness questionnaire. The result of this combination will create a visualization that is sensitive to changes in the cardiovascular health of the patient and communicates this information to the user in a meaningful, salient and intuitive manner.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2003.1250352

Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2003,Exploring curved anatomic structures with surface sections - IEEE Conference Publication,"The extraction of planar sections from volume images is the most commonly used technique for inspecting and visualizing anatomic structures. We propose to generalize the concept of planar section to the extraction of curved cross-sections (free form surfaces). Compared with planar slices, curved cross-sections may easily follow the trajectory of tubular structures and organs such as the aorta or the colon. They may be extracted from a 3D volume, displayed as a 3D view and possibly flattened. Flattening of curved cross-sections allows to inspect spatially complex relationship between anatomic structures and their neighborhood. They also allow to carry out measurements along a specific orientation. For the purpose of facilitating the interactive specification of free form surfaces, users may navigate in real time within the body and select the slices on which the surface control points will be positioned. Immediate feedback is provided by displaying boundary curves as cylindrical markers within a 3D view composed of anatomic organs, planar slices and possibly free form surface sections. Extraction of curved surface sections is an additional service that is available online as a Java applet (http://visiblehuman.epfl.ch). It may be used as an advanced tool for exploring and teaching anatomy.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2003.1250351
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2003,Visualizing industrial CT volume data for nondestructive testing applications - IEEE Conference Publication,"This paper describes a set of techniques developed for the visualization of high- resolution volume data generated from industrial computed tomography for nondestructive testing (NDT) applications. Because the data are typically noisy and contain fine features, direct volume rendering methods do not always give us satisfactory results. We have coupled region growing techniques and a 2D histogram interface to facilitate volumetric feature extraction. The new interface allows the user to conveniently identify, separate or composite, and compare features in the data. To lower the cost of segmentation, we show how partial region growing results can suggest a reasonably good classification function for the rendering of the whole volume. The NDT applications that we work on demand visualization tasks including not only feature extraction and visual inspection, but also modeling and measurement of concealed structures in volumetric objects. An efficient filtering and modeling process for generating surface representation of extracted features is also introduced. Four CT data sets for preliminary NDT are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new visualization strategy that we have developed.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2003.1250418
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2003,Adaptive design of a global opacity transfer function for direct volume rendering of ultrasound data - IEEE Conference Publication,"While there are a couple of transfer function design approaches for CT and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) data, direct volume rendering of ultrasound data still relies on manual adjustment of an inflexible piecewise linear opacity transfer function (OTF) on a trial-and-error basis. The main challenge of automatically designing an OTF for visualization of sonographic data is the low signal-to-noise ratio in combination with real time data acquisition at frame rates up to 25 volumes per second. In this paper, we present an efficient solution of this task. Our approach is based on the evaluation of tube cores, i.e., collections of voxels gathered by traversing the volume in rendering directions. We use information about the probable position of an interface between tissues of different echogenicity to adaptively design an OTF in a multiplicative way. We show the appropriateness of our approach by examples, deliberately on data sets of moderate quality arising frequently in clinical settings.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2003.1250411
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2003,Visualization of noisy and biased volume data using first and second order derivative techniques - IEEE Conference Publication,"The quality of volume visualization depends strongly on the quality of the underlying data. In virtual colonoscopy, CT data should be acquired at a low radiation dose that results in a low signal-to-noise ratio. Alternatively, MRI data is acquired without ionizing radiation, but suffers from noise and bias (global signal fluctuations). Current volume visualization techniques often do not produce good results with noisy or biased data. This paper describes methods for volume visualization that deal with these imperfections. The techniques are based on specially adapted edge detectors using first and second order derivative filters. The filtering is integrated into the visualization process. The first order derivative method results in good quality images but suffers from localization bias. The second order method has better surface localization, especially in highly curved areas. It guarantees minimal detail smoothing resulting in a better visualization of polyps.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2003.1250397
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2003,Hybrid segmentation and exploration of the human lungs - IEEE Conference Publication,"Segmentation of the tracheo- bronchial tree of the lungs is notoriously difficult. This is due to the fact that the small size of some of the anatomical structures is subject to partial volume effects. Furthermore, the limited intensity contrast between the participating materials (air, blood, and tissue) increases the segmentation of difficulties. In this paper, we propose a hybrid segmentation method which is based on a pipeline of three segmentation stages to extract the lower airways down to the seventh generation of the bronchi. User interaction is limited to the specification of a seed point inside the easily detectable trachea at the upper end of the lower airways. Similarly, the complementary vascular tree of the lungs can be segmented.

Once the data is scanned, one can apply post-processing techniques for data enhancement, modification or presentation. For demonstration purposes we chose to scan a Christmas tree which exhibits high complexity which is difficult or even impossible to handle with other techniques.

We introduce here an efficient and accurate technique called object-order ray- casting that can achieve up to 10 fps on current workstations. Like usual ray- casting, colors and opacities are evenly sampled along the ray, but now within a new object-order algorithm. Thus, it allows to combine the main advantages of both worlds in term of speed and quality.

A method is proposed to fit an approximating radial basis function to the group of data samples. An explicit surface is then obtained by iso-surfacing the function. In most previous 3D ultrasound research, a pre-processing step is taken to interpolate the data into a regular voxel array and a corresponding loss of resolution.

A new two-step technique is presented which deals with the problems of double appearance of polyps and nonuniform sampling that other colon unfolding techniques suffer from. In the first step, a distance map from a central path induces nonlinear rays for unambiguous parameterization of the surface.

We propose a novel opacity classification algorithm for 3D ultrasound datasets, based on the variational principle. More specifically, we compute a volumetric opacity function that optimally satisfies a set of simultaneous requirements. One requirement makes the function attain nonzero values only in the vicinity of a user-specified value, resulting in soft shells of finite, approximately constant thickness around isosurfaces in the volume. Other requirements are designed to make the function smoother and less sensitive to noise and speckle. The computed opacity function lends itself well to explicit geometric surface extraction, as well as to direct volume rendering at interactive rates. We also describe a new splatting algorithm that is particularly well suited for displaying soft opacity shells. Several examples and comparisons are included to illustrate our approach and demonstrate its effectiveness on real 3D ultrasound datasets.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2001.964539
Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,2001,Case study: interacting with cortical flat maps of the human brain - IEEE Conference Publication,"The complex geometry of the human brain contains many folds and fissures, making it impossible to view the entire surface at once. Since most of the cortical activity occurs on these folds, it is desirable to be able to view the entire surface of the brain in a single view. This can be achieved using quasi- conformal flat maps of the cortical surface. Computational and visualization tools are now needed to be able to interact with these flat maps of the brain to gain information about spatial and functional relationships that might not otherwise be apparent. Such information can contribute to earlier diagnostic tools for diseases and improved treatment. Our group is developing visualization and analysis tools that will help elucidate new information about the human brain through the interaction between a cortical surface and its corresponding quasiconformal flat map.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2001.964553

For the visualization of these symbolic models, concatenated truncated cones are smoothly blended at branching points. We put emphasis on the quality of the visualizations which is achieved by anti-aliasing operations in different stages of the visualization. The methods presented are referred to as HQVV (high quality vessel visualization). Scalable techniques are provided to explore vascular structures of different orders of magnitude. The hierarchy as well as the diameter of the branches of vascular systems are used to restrict visualizations to relevant subtrees and to emphasize parts of vascular systems. Our research is inspired by clear visualizations in textbooks and is targeted toward medical education and therapy planning. We describe the application of vessel visualization techniques for liver surgery planning. For this application it is crucial to recognize the morphology and branching pattern of vascular systems as well as the basic spatial relations between vessels and other anatomic structures.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2001.964538

To obtain a standardized 3D visualization, digital videos are automatically generated. The time-consuming video production caused by the manual delineation of structures, software based volume rendering, and the interactive definition of an optimized camera path is considerably improved with a fully automatic strategy. Therefore, a previously suggested approach (C. Rezk-Salama, 2000) is applied which uses an optimized transfer function as a template and automatically adapts it to an individual dataset. Furthermore, we introduce hardware-accelerated morphologic filtering in order to detect the location of mid-size and giant aneurysms. The actual generation of the video is finally integrated into a hardware accelerated off-screen rendering process based on 3D texture mapping, ensuring fast visualization of high quality.

The common approach for the visualization of a virtual endoscopy is surface rendering, yielding images close to a real endoscopy. If external structures are of interest, volume rendering techniques have to be used. These methods do not display the exact shape of the inner lumen very well. For certain applications, e.g. operation planning of a transbronchial biopsy, both the shape of the inner lumen as well as outer structures like blood vessels and the tumor have to be delineated.

Different structures within the data set are rendered locally by either MIP or DVR on an object-by-object basis. Globally, all the results of subsequent object renderings are combined in a merging step (usually compositing in our case). This allows us to selectively choose the most suitable technique for depicting each object within the data, while keeping the amount of information contained in the image at a reasonable level. This is especially useful when inner structures should be visualized together with semi-transparent outer parts, similar to the focus-and-context approach known from information visualization.

Our method can be used for a variety of segmentation needs with little or no modification. It aims at fulfilling the dual and often conflicting requirements of a fast and accurate segmentation and also eliminates the undesirable partial volume effect which contemporary approaches cannot. For segmentation and digital cleansing, we use the peculiar characteristics exhibited by the intersection of any two distinct-intensity regions. To detect these intersections we cast rays through the volume, which we call the segmentation rays as they assist in the segmentation. We then associate a certain task of reconstruction and classification with each intersection the ray detects. We further use volumetric contrast enhancement to reconstruct surface lost by segmentation (if any), which aids in improving the quality of the volume rendering.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2000.885674

In this way, the system firstly visualizes a spreadsheet on a plane in three-dimensional space, and draws arcs between interrelated cells. By allowing a user to select an arbitrary cell and lift it up with direct manipulation, the system utilizes the third dimension to ameliorate visual occlusion of crossing arcs. As the user lifts a focused cell up, the interrelated cells are lifted up together; thus hidden dataflow networks can be visually intelligible interactively. Because spreadsheets are aimed at calculation itself rather than appearances of outputs, their mechanism is relatively invisible and not obvious for ordinary users. Our visualization helps such users to understand structures and mechanism of spreadsheets.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/INFVIS.1999.801861

We describe a new method that determines the membership of a given sample point to an object by reclassifying the sample point using interpolation of the original intensity values and searching for the best fitting object in the neighbourhood. Using a ray-casting approach we then compute the surface location between successive sample points along the viewing-ray by interpolation or bisection. The accurate calculation of the object boundary enables a much more precise computation of the gray-level-gradient yielding the surface normal.

Surface rendering is sufficient for implementing such a procedure to obtain an overview of the interior surface of the colon at interactive rendering speeds. Unfortunately, physicians can not use it to explore tissues beneath the surface to differentiate between benign and malignant structures. In this paper, we present a direct volume rendering approach based on perspective ray casting, as a supplement to the surface navigation. To accelerate the rendering speed, surface-assistant techniques are used to adapt the resampling rates by skipping the empty space inside the colon. In addition, a parallel version of the algorithm has been implemented on a shared-memory multiprocessing architecture.

They compute perspective projections at each frame, allow trilinear interpolation of sample points, and render both gray scale and RGB volumes by volumetric compositing. The implementation handles arbitrarily large volumes, by dynamically swapping data within the local depth-limited frustum into main memory as the viewpoint moves through the volume. They describe a new ray casting algorithm that takes advantage of the coherence inherent in adjacent frames to generate a sequence of approximate animated frames much faster than they could be computed individually.

Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,1997,Volume rendering of abdominal aortic aneurysms - IEEE Conference Publication,"One well known application area of volume rendering is the reconstruction and visualization of output from medical scanners like computed tomography (CT). 2D greyscale slices produced by these scanners can be reconstructed and displayed onscreen as a 3D model. Volume visualization of medical images must address two important issues. First, it is difficult to segment medical scans into individual materials based only on intensity values. Second, although greyscale images are the normal method for displaying medical volumes, these types of images are not necessarily appropriate for highlighting regions of interest within the volume. Studies of the human visual system have shown that individual intensity values are difficult to detect in a greyscale image. In these situations colour is a more effective visual feature. We addressed both problems during the visualization of CT scans of abdominal aortic aneurysms. We have developed a classification method that empirically segments regions of interest in each of the 2D slices. We use a perceptual colour selection technique to identify each region of interest in both the 2D slices and the 3D reconstructed volumes. The result is a colourized volume that the radiologists are using to rapidly and accurately identify the locations and spatial interactions of different materials from their scans. Our technique is being used in an experimental post operative environment to help to evaluate the results of surgery designed to prevent the rupture of the aneurysm. In the future, we hope to use the technique during the planning of placement of support grafts prior to the actual operation.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1997.663855

This paper lists the particular visualization and control techniques that have enabled actual scientific discovery, including specific examples of insight gained using each technique. This information can help scientists determine which features are likely to be useful in their particular application, and which would be just sugar coating. It can also guide computer scientists to suggest the appropriate type of interface to help solve a particular problem. We have found benefit in advanced rendering with natural viewpoint control (but not always), from semi-automatic control techniques, from force feedback during manipulation, and from storing/replaying data for an entire experiment.

We use binary space partition (BSP) tree data structures to provide non- intersecting, visibility-ordered primitives for accurate opacity accumulation images. New in our system is a method of using parallel, time-shifted BSP trees to efficiently manage the continuously captured ultrasound data and to decrease the variability in image generation time between output frames.

Biology and Bioinformatics,Vis,1996,Flexible information visualization of multivariate data from biological sequence similarity searches - IEEE Conference Publication,"Information visualization faces challenges presented by the need to represent abstract data and the relationships within the data. Previously, we presented a system for visualizing similarities between a single DNA sequence and a large database of other DNA sequences (E.H. Chi et al., 1995). Similarity algorithms generate similarity information in textual reports that can be hundreds or thousands of pages long. Our original system visualized the most important variables from these reports. However, the biologists we work with found this system so useful they requested visual representations of other variables. We present an enhanced system for interactive exploration of this multivariate data. We identify a larger set of useful variables in the information space. The new system involves more variables, so it focuses on exploring subsets of the data. We present an interactive system allowing mapping of different variables to different axes, incorporating animation using a time axis, and providing tools for viewing subsets of the data. Detail-on-demand is preserved by hyperlinks to the analysis reports. We present three case studies illustrating the use of these techniques.

Minimal area triangulations are used to guide the surface construction, and the final surface reflects the optimality of the triangulation. The resulting surface differs from the initial triangulation in two important ways: it is smooth (as opposed to the piecewise planar triangulation), and it is in tensor product form (as opposed to the irregular triangular mesh). The surface reconstruction is efficient because we do not require an exact minimal surface. The triangulations are used as strong hints, but no more than that. The method requires the computation of both open and closed isoparametric curves of the surface, using triangulations as a guide. These isoparametric curves form a tensor product Bezier surface. We show how to control sampling density by filling and pruning isoparametric curves, for accuracy and economy. A rectangular grid of points is produced that is compatible with the expected format for a tensor product surface interpolation, so that a host of well- supported methods are available to generate and manipulate the surface.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1995.480820

This paper proposes a visual analytics system, Visual Analysis of E-transaction Time-Series (VAET), that allows the analysts to interactively explore large transaction datasets for insights about time-varying transactions. With a set of analyst-determined training samples, VAET automatically estimates the saliency of each transaction in a large time- series using a probabilistic decision tree learner. It provides an effective time-of-saliency (TOS) map where the analysts can explore a large number of transactions at different time granularities. Interesting transactions are further encoded with KnotLines, a compact visual representation that captures both the temporal variations and the contextual connection of transactions. The analysts can thus explore, select, and investigate knotlines of interest.

Biomedical Science and Medicine,InfoVis,2013,GPLOM: The Generalized Plot Matrix for Visualizing Multidimensional Multivariate Data,"Scatterplot matrices (SPLOMs), parallel coordinates, and glyphs can all be used to visualize the multiple continuous variables (i.e., dependent variables or measures) in multidimensional multivariate data. However, these techniques are not well suited to visualizing many categorical variables (i.e., independent variables or dimensions). To visualize multiple categorical variables, 'hierarchical axes' that 'stack dimensions' have been used in systems like Polaris and Tableau. However, this approach does not scale well beyond a small number of categorical variables. Emerson et al. [8] extend the matrix paradigm of the SPLOM to simultaneously visualize several categorical and continuous variables, displaying many kinds of charts in the matrix depending on the kinds of variables involved. We propose a variant of their technique, called the Generalized Plot Matrix (GPLOM). The GPLOM restricts Emerson et al.'s technique to only three kinds of charts (scatterplots for pairs of continuous variables, heatmaps for pairs of categorical variables, and barcharts for pairings of categorical and continuous variable), in an effort to make it easier to understand. At the same time, the GPLOM extends Emerson et al.'s work by demonstrating interactive techniques suited to the matrix of charts. We discuss the visual design and interactive features of our GPLOM prototype, including a textual search feature allowing users to quickly locate values or variables by name. We also present a user study that compared performance with Tableau and our GPLOM prototype, that found that GPLOM is significantly faster in certain cases, and not significantly slower in other cases.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2013.160

In this paper, we present two techniques and applications that enable the user to interactively analyze large amounts of time series data in real-time in order to get insight into the development of assets, market sectors, countries, and the financial market as a whole. The first technique allows users to quickly analyze combinations of single assets, market sectors as well as countries, compare them to each other, and to visually discover the periods of time where market sectors and countries get into turbulence. The second application clusters a selection of large amounts of financial time series data according to their similarity, and analyzes the distribution of the assets among market sectors. This allows users to identify the characteristic graphs which are representative for the development of a particular market sector, and also to identify the assets which behave considerably differently compared to other assets in the same sector.

Biomedical Science and Medicine,InfoVis,2006,Visual Exploration of Complex Time-Varying Graphs,"Many graph drawing and visualization algorithms, such as force-directed layout and line-dot rendering, work very well on relatively small and sparse graphs. However, they often produce extremely tangled results and exhibit impractical running times for highly non-planar graphs with large edge density. And very few graph layout algorithms support dynamic time-varying graphs; applying them independently to each frame produces distracting temporally incoherent visualizations. We have developed a new visualization technique based on a novel approach to hierarchically structuring dense graphs via stratification. Using this structure, we formulate a hierarchical force-directed layout algorithm that is both efficient and produces quality graph layouts. The stratification of the graph also allows us to present views of the data that abstract away many small details of its structure. Rather than displaying all edges and nodes at once, resulting in a convoluted rendering, we present an interactive tool that filters edges and nodes using the graph hierarchy and allows users to drill down into the graph for details. Our layout algorithm also accommodates time- varying graphs in a natural way, producing a temporally coherent animation that can be used to analyze and extract trends from dynamic graph data. For example, we demonstrate the use of our method to explore financial correlation data for the U.S. stock market in the period from 1990 to 2005. The user can easily analyze the time-varying correlation graph of the market, uncovering information such as market sector trends, representative stocks for portfolio construction, and the interrelationship of stocks over time.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2006.193

In a study with 117 participants, we compared the benefit of static vs. dynamic visualization training tools on learners with different spatial abilities performing a typical 3-D task (specifically, creating orthographic projections of a 3-D object). We measured the spatial abilities of the participants using the Mental Rotation Test (MRT) and classified participants into two groups (high and low abilities) to examine how the participants' abilities predicted change in performance after training with static versus dynamic training tools.

Creating animations is an essential task in presenting complex scientific visualizations. Existing visualization systems use an established animation function based on keyframes selected by the user. This approach is limited in providing the optimal in-between views of the data. Alternatively, computer graphics and virtual reality camera motion planning is frequently focused on collision free movement in a virtual walkthrough. For semi-transparent, fuzzy, or blobby volume data the collision free objective becomes insufficient. Here, we provide a set of essential criteria focused on computing camera paths to establish effective animations of volume data. Our dynamic multi-criteria solver coupled with a force-directed routing algorithm enables rapid generation of camera paths. Once users review the resulting animation and evaluate the camera motion, they are able to determine how each criterion impacts path generation. In this paper, we demonstrate how incorporating this animation approach with an interactive volume visualization system reduces the effort in creating context-aware and coherent animations.

Interactivity may be hindered due to many factors, e.g. large data size,high resolution or complexity of a data set, or an expensive rendering algorithm. We present a novel framework for visualizing volumedata that enables interactive exploration using proxy images, without accessing the original 3D data. Data exploration using directvolume rendering requires multiple (often redundant) accesses to possibly large amounts of data. The notion of visualization by proxyrelies on the ability to defer operations traditionally used for exploring 3D data to a more suitable intermediate representation forinteraction - proxy images.

This classic camera model has important advantages such as simplicity, which enables efficient software and hardware implementations, and similarity to the human eye, which yields images familiar to the user. However, the planar pinhole camera has only a single viewpoint, which limits images to parts of the scene to which there is direct line of sight. In this paper we introduce the curved ray camera to address the single viewpoint limitation. Rays are C1-continuous curves that bend to circumvent occluders. Our camera is designed to provide a fast 3-D point projection operation, which enables interactive visualization. The camera supports both 3-D surface and volume datasets.

"Business, Finance, Economy, Manufacturing",Vis,2007,LiveSync: Deformed Viewing Spheres for Knowledge-Based Navigation,"Although real-time interactive volume rendering is available even for very large data sets, this visualization method is used quite rarely in the clinical practice. We suspect this is because it is very complicated and time consuming to adjust the parameters to achieve meaningful results. The clinician has to take care of the appropriate viewpoint, zooming, transfer function setup, clipping planes and other parameters. Because of this, most often only 2D slices of the data set are examined. Our work introduces LiveSync, a new concept to synchronize 2D slice views and volumetric views of medical data sets. Through intuitive picking actions on the slice, the users define the anatomical structures they are interested in. The 3D volumetric view is updated automatically with the goal that the users are provided with expressive result images. To achieve this live synchronization we use a minimal set of derived information without the need for segmented data sets or data-specific pre- computations. The components we consider are the picked point, slice view zoom, patient orientation, viewpoint history, local object shape and visibility. We introduce deformed viewing spheres which encode the viewpoint quality for the components. A combination of these deformed viewing spheres is used to estimate a good viewpoint.

"Business, Finance, Economy, Manufacturing",Vis,2006,Dynamic View Selection for Time-Varying Volumes,"Animation is an effective way to show how time-varying phenomena evolve over time. A key issue of generating a good animation is to select ideal views through which the user can perceive the maximum amount of information from the time-varying dataset. In this paper, we first propose an improved view selection method for static data. The method measures the quality of a static view by analyzing the opacity, color and curvature distributions of the corresponding volume rendering images from the given view. Our view selection metric prefers an even opacity distribution with a larger projection area, a larger area of salient features' colors with an even distribution among the salient features, and more perceived curvatures. We use this static view selection method and a dynamic programming approach to select time-varying views. The time-varying view selection maximizes the information perceived from the time-varying dataset based on the constraints that the time-varying view should show smooth changes of direction and near-constant speed. We also introduce a method that allows the user to generate a smooth transition between any two views in a given time step, with the perceived information maximized as well. By combining the static and dynamic view selection methods, the users are able to generate a time-varying view that shows the maximum amount of information from a time-varying data set",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2006.137

A characteristic viewpoint is estimated by a novel information-theoretic framework which is based on the mutual information measure. Viewpoints change smoothly by switching the focus from one feature to another one. This mechanism is controlled by changes in the importance distribution among features in the volume. The highest importance is assigned to the feature in focus. Apart from viewpoint selection, the focusing mechanism also steers visual emphasis by assigning a visually more prominent representation. To allow a clear view on features that are normally occluded by other parts of the volume, the focusing for example incorporates cut-away views",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2006.152

Although several methods have been proposed that calculate the optimal positions of viewpoints especially for 3D surface meshes, none has been done for solid objects such as volumes. This paper presents a new method of locating such optimal viewpoints when visualizing volumes using direct volume rendering. The major idea behind our method is to decompose an entire volume into a set of feature components, and then find a globally optimal viewpoint by finding a compromise between locally optimal viewpoints for the components. As the feature components, the method employs interval volumes and their combinations that characterize the topological transitions of isosurfaces according to the scalar field. Furthermore, opacity transfer functions are also utilized to assign different weights to the decomposed components so that users can emphasize features of specific interest in the volumes. Several examples of volume datasets together with their optimal positions of viewpoints are exhibited in order to demonstrate that the method can effectively guide naive users to find optimal projections of volumes.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2005.1532834

It can be used to find informative views for a given scene, or to find a minimal set of representative views which capture the entire scene. It becomes particularly useful when the visualization process is non-interactive - for example, when visualizing large datasets or time-varying sequences. We introduce a viewpoint \""goodness\"" measure based on the formulation of entropy from information theory. The measure takes into account the transfer function, the data distribution and the visibility of the voxels. Combined with viewpoint properties like view- likelihood and view-stability, this technique can be used as a guide, which suggests \""interesting\"" viewpoints for further exploration. Domain knowledge is incorporated into the algorithm via an importance transfer function or volume. This allows users to obtain view selection behaviors tailored to their specific situations. We generate a view space partitioning, and select one representative view for each partition. Together, this set of views encapsulates the \""interesting\"" and distinct views of the data.

However, the conventional centerline approach, generating only the longitudinal distance along the colon, lacks the necessary orientation information to synchronize the virtual navigation cameras in both scanned positions. In this paper we describe a semi-automatic method to detect teniae coli from a colonic surface model reconstructed from CT colonography. Teniae coli are three bands of longitudinal smooth muscle on the surface of the colon. They form a triple helix structure from the appendix to the sigmoid colon and are ideal references for virtual navigation. Our method was applied to 3 patients resulting in 6 data sets (supine and prone scans). The detected teniae coli matched well with our visual inspection.

Yet traditional visibility culling algorithms were mainly designed for static data, without consideration of such potential temporal coherency. We explore the use of temporal occlusion coherence (TOC) to accelerate visibility culling for time-varying volume rendering. In our algorithm, the opacity of volume blocks is encoded by means of plenoptic opacity functions (POFs). A coherence- based block fusion technique is employed to coalesce time-coherent data blocks over a span of time steps into a single, representative block. Then POFs need only be computed for these representative blocks. To quickly determine the subvolumes that do not require updates in their visibility status for each subsequent time step, a hierarchical \""TOC tree\"" data structure is constructed to store the spans of coherent time steps. To achieve maximal culling potential, while remaining conservative, we have extended our previous POP into an optimized POP (OPOP) encoding scheme for this specific scenario. To test our general TOC and OPOF approach, we have designed a parallel time- varying volume rendering algorithm accelerated by visibility culling. Results from experimental runs on a 32-processor cluster confirm both the effectiveness and scalability of our approach.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2004.110

Combining these views into one display can be done by: (1) orientation icon (i.e., separate windows), (2) in-place methods (e.g., clip and cutting planes), and (3) a new method called ExoVis. How 2D and 3D views are displayed affects ease of mental registration (understanding the spatial relationship between views), an important factor influencing user performance. This paper compares the above methods in terms of their ability to support mental registration. Empirical results show that mental registration is significantly easier with in-place displays than with ExoVis, and significantly easier with ExoVis than with orientation icons. Different mental transformation strategies can explain this result. The results suggest that ExoVis may be a better alternative to orientation icons when in-place displays are not appropriate (e.g., when in-place methods hide data or cut the 3D view into several pieces).",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2003.1250396

To address these issues, we have designed a Plenoptic Opacity Function (POF) scheme to encode the view-dependent opacity of a volume block. POFs are computed off- line during a pre-processing stage, only once for each block. We show that using POFs is (i) an efficient, conservative and effective way to encode the opacity variations of a volume block for a range of views, (ii) flexible for re-use by a family of opacity transfer functions without the need for additional off-line processing, and (iii) highly scalable for use in massively parallel implementations.

Based on this concept, we present a method for computing an optimal camera position for each instant of time. Since the explored data are not static, but change depending on the explored scene time, we also discuss a method for animation generation. In order to avoid sudden changes of the camera position, when the previous method is applied for each frame (point in time), we introduce pseudo-events in time, which expand the bounding box defined by the currently active events of interest. In particular, this technique allows events happening in a future point in time to be taken into account such that when this time becomes current, all events of interest are already within the current viewing frustum of the camera.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2002.1183826

We present a new algorithm for the construction of continuous area cartograms that was developed by viewing their construction as a constrained optimization problem. The algorithm uses a relaxation method that exploits hierarchical resolution, constrained dynamics, and a scheme that alternates goals of achieving correct region areas and adjusting region shapes. It is compared favorably to existing methods in its ability to preserve region shape recognition cues, while still achieving high accuracy.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1998.745303
"Business, Finance, Economy, Manufacturing",Vis,1997,Architectural walkthroughs using portal textures - IEEE Conference Publication,This paper outlines a method to dynamically replace portals with textures in a cell-partitioned model. The rendering complexity is reduced to the geometry of the current cell thus increasing interactive performance. A portal is a generalization of windows and doors. It connects two adjacent cells (or rooms). Each portal of the current cell that is some distance away from the viewpoint is rendered as a texture. The portal texture (smoothly) returns to geometry when the viewpoint gets close to the portal. This way all portal sequences (not too close to the viewpoint) have a depth complexity of one. The size of each texture and distance at which the transition occurs is configurable for each portal.,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1997.663903
"Business, Finance, Economy, Manufacturing",Vis,1997,UFLIC: a line integral convolution algorithm for visualizing unsteady flows - IEEE Conference Publication,"The paper presents an algorithm, UFLIC (Unsteady Flow LIC), to visualize vector data in unsteady flow fields. Using line integral convolution (LIC) as the underlying method, a new convolution algorithm is proposed that can effectively trace the flow's global features over time. The new algorithm consists of a time-accurate value depositing scheme and a successive feedforward method. The value depositing scheme accurately models the flow advection, and the successive feedforward method maintains the coherence between animation frames. The new algorithm can produce time-accurate, highly coherent flow animations to highlight global features in unsteady flow fields. CFD scientists, for the first time, are able to visualize unsteady surface flows using the algorithm.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1997.663898
"Business, Finance, Economy, Manufacturing",Vis,1997,Virtualized reality: constructing time-varying virtual worlds from real world events - IEEE Conference Publication,"Virtualized reality is a modeling technique that constructs full 3D virtual representations of dynamic events from multiple video streams. Image-based stereo is used to compute a range image corresponding to each intensity image in each video stream. Each range and intensity image pair encodes the scene structure and appearance of the scene visible to the camera at that moment, and is therefore called a visible surface model (VSM). A single time instant of the dynamic event can be modeled as a collection of VSMs from different viewpoints, and the full event can be modeled as a sequence of static scenes-the 3D equivalent of video. Alternatively, the collection of VSMs at a single time can be fused into a global 3D surface model, thus creating a traditional virtual representation out of real world events. Global modeling has the added benefit of eliminating the need to hand-edit the range images to correct errors made in stereo, a drawback of previous techniques. Like image-based rendering models, these virtual representations can be used to synthesize nearly any view of the virtualized event. For this reason, the paper includes a detailed comparison of existing view synthesis techniques with the authors' own approach. In the virtualized representations, however, scene structure is explicitly represented and therefore easily manipulated, for example by adding virtual objects to (or removing virtualized objects from) the model without interfering with real event. Virtualized reality, then, is a platform not only for image-based rendering but also for 3D scene manipulation.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1997.663893
"Business, Finance, Economy, Manufacturing",Vis,1997,An anti-aliasing technique for splatting - IEEE Conference Publication,"Splatting is a popular direct volume rendering algorithm. However, the algorithm does not correctly render cases where the volume sampling rate is higher than the image sampling rate (e.g. more than one voxel maps into a pixel). This situation arises with orthographic projections of high-resolution volumes, as well as with perspective projections of volumes of any resolution. The result is potentially severe spatial and temporal aliasing artifacts. Some volume ray-casting algorithms avoid these artifacts by employing reconstruction kernels which vary in width as the rays diverge. Unlike ray-casting algorithms, existing splatting algorithms do not have an equivalent mechanism for avoiding these artifacts. The authors propose such a mechanism, which delivers high-quality splatted images and has the potential for a very efficient hardware implementation.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1997.663882
"Business, Finance, Economy, Manufacturing",Vis,1997,Constrained 3D navigation with 2D controllers - IEEE Conference Publication,"Navigation through 3D spaces is required in many interactive graphics and virtual reality applications. The authors consider the subclass of situations in which a 2D device such as a mouse controls smooth movements among viewpoints for a \""through the screen\"" display of a 3D world. Frequently, there is a poor match between the goal of such a navigation activity, the control device, and the skills of the average user. They propose a unified mathematical framework for incorporating context- dependent constraints into the generalized viewpoint generation problem. These designer-supplied constraint modes provide a middle ground between the triviality of a single camera animation path and the confusing excess freedom of common unconstrained control paradigms. They illustrate the approach with a variety of examples, including terrain models, interior architectural spaces, and complex molecules.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1997.663876
"Business, Finance, Economy, Manufacturing",Vis,1997,Interactive volume rendering for virtual colonoscopy - IEEE Conference Publication,"3D virtual colonoscopy has recently been proposed as a non-invasive alternative procedure for the visualization of the human colon. Surface rendering is sufficient for implementing such a procedure to obtain an overview of the interior surface of the colon at interactive rendering speeds. Unfortunately, physicians can not use it to explore tissues beneath the surface to differentiate between benign and malignant structures. In this paper, we present a direct volume rendering approach based on perspective ray casting, as a supplement to the surface navigation. To accelerate the rendering speed, surface-assistant techniques are used to adapt the resampling rates by skipping the empty space inside the colon. In addition, a parallel version of the algorithm has been implemented on a shared-memory multiprocessing architecture. Experiments have been conducted on both simulation and patient data sets.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1997.663915
